Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces **Neural Textured Deformable Meshes**, which are 3D object models with deformable geometry and neural texture maps that can be used for analysis-by-synthesis tasks such as pose estimation, shape reconstruction, and semantic segmentation.
- **Why**: The paper aims to achieve higher robustness than conventional neural networks under out-of-distribution scenarios, such as occlusion and domain shift, by using approximate analysis-by-synthesis based on render-and-compare algorithms on neural features.
- **How**: The paper trains the deformable mesh as a neural field and covers it with whole-surface neural texture maps that have spatial discriminability. During inference, the paper optimizes the 3D pose and shape parameters of the model using differentiable rendering to best reconstruct the feature map of the test image. The paper evaluates the model on real-world images and shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pose estimation and shape reconstruction, and is competitive on semantic segmentation. The paper also demonstrates the robustness of the model under occlusion and domain shift scenarios.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It proposes a novel 3D object model, Neural Textured Deformable Meshes, that combines deformable geometry and neural texture maps for analysis-by-synthesis tasks.
- It introduces a render-and-compare algorithm on neural features that can optimize both camera parameters and object geometries using differentiable rendering.
- It shows that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on pose estimation and shape reconstruction, and competitive performance on semantic segmentation, on real-world images.
- It demonstrates that the proposed model is more robust than conventional neural networks under out-of-distribution scenarios, such as occlusion and domain shift.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper defines a Neural Textured Deformable Mesh (NTDM) as a 3D object model that consists of a deformable mesh and a neural texture map. The deformable mesh is parameterized by a set of vertices and faces, and the neural texture map is a function that maps each point on the mesh surface to a feature vector. The paper trains the NTDM as a neural field using a graph convolutional network (GCN) that takes as input the initial mesh and outputs the deformed mesh and the neural texture map.
- The paper proposes a render-and-compare algorithm on neural features that can infer the 3D pose and shape of an object from a single image. The algorithm takes as input an image and an NTDM, and outputs the optimal camera parameters and object geometries that minimize the reconstruction loss between the rendered feature map and the extracted feature map of the image. The paper uses differentiable rendering to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the camera parameters and object geometries, and updates them using gradient descent.
- The paper applies the proposed method to three analysis-by-synthesis tasks: pose estimation, shape reconstruction, and semantic segmentation. For pose estimation, the paper uses a pretrained NTDM and optimizes only the camera parameters. For shape reconstruction, the paper uses a pretrained NTDM and optimizes both the camera parameters and object geometries. For semantic segmentation, the paper uses an NTDM trained with semantic labels and renders the semantic map of the object. The paper evaluates the performance of the method on various datasets and compares it with existing methods.

## Pseudo Code

Here is a possible pseudo code to implement the paper:

```python
# Define the Neural Textured Deformable Mesh (NTDM) class
class NTDM:
  def __init__(self, mesh, gcn):
    # mesh: a 3D mesh object with vertices and faces
    # gcn: a graph convolutional network that takes as input the mesh and outputs the deformed mesh and the neural texture map
    self.mesh = mesh
    self.gcn = gcn
  
  def forward(self):
    # Forward pass of the NTDM
    # Returns the deformed mesh and the neural texture map
    deformed_mesh, neural_texture_map = self.gcn(self.mesh)
    return deformed_mesh, neural_texture_map

  def render(self, camera):
    # Render the feature map of the NTDM given a camera object
    # camera: a camera object that contains the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
    # Returns the rendered feature map
    rendered_feature_map = differentiable_rendering(deformed_mesh, neural_texture_map, camera)
    return rendered_feature_map

# Define the render-and-compare algorithm on neural features
def render_and_compare(image, ntdm):
  # image: a single image of an object
  # ntdm: an NTDM object
  # Returns the optimal camera parameters and object geometries

  # Extract the feature map of the image using a feature extractor network
  feature_map = feature_extractor(image)

  # Initialize the camera parameters and object geometries randomly or using prior knowledge
  camera = init_camera()
  ntdm.mesh = init_mesh()

  # Define the reconstruction loss function as the L2 distance between the rendered feature map and the extracted feature map
  def loss():
    return L2_distance(ntdm.render(camera), feature_map)

  # Optimize the camera parameters and object geometries using gradient descent
  optimizer = gradient_descent()
  for i in range(max_iterations):
    optimizer.step(loss)

  # Return the optimal camera parameters and object geometries
  return camera, ntdm.mesh

# Apply the method to pose estimation, shape reconstruction, and semantic segmentation tasks

# Load a pretrained NTDM for pose estimation
ntdm_pose = load_ntdm("ntdm_pose.pth")

# Load a pretrained NTDM for shape reconstruction
ntdm_shape = load_ntdm("ntdm_shape.pth")

# Load an NTDM trained with semantic labels for semantic segmentation
ntdm_segment = load_ntdm("ntdm_segment.pth")

# Load a test image of an object
image = load_image("test.jpg")

# Perform pose estimation by optimizing only the camera parameters
camera_pose, _ = render_and_compare(image, ntdm_pose)

# Perform shape reconstruction by optimizing both the camera parameters and object geometries
camera_shape, mesh_shape = render_and_compare(image, ntdm_shape)

# Perform semantic segmentation by rendering the semantic map of the object
camera_segment, _ = render_and_compare(image, ntdm_segment)
semantic_map = ntdm_segment.render(camera_segment)

# Display the results
display_results(image, camera_pose, camera_shape, mesh_shape, semantic_map)
