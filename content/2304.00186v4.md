## What, Why and How

[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00186 "Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning"
[2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00186v1.pdf "arXiv.org e-Print archive"

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that can produce customized images of a target subject based on textual descriptions, without fine-tuning for each subject.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text-to-image generation models that require expensive and time-consuming subject-specific optimization, and to enable instant and diverse image generation for any subject of interest.
- **How**: The paper leverages apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is trained to imitate the behavior of a large number of subject-specific expert models. The expert models are obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model on millions of image clusters mined from the Internet. The apprentice model learns to generate images that match the text and the subject style by observing the input-output pairs of the expert models. The paper evaluates SuTI on two challenging datasets, DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, and shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality, diversity, and efficiency.


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- They introduce SuTI, a novel Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that can generate high-quality and customized images of any subject given a few demonstrations and a textual description, without any subject-specific optimization.
- They propose a new learning paradigm called apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model learns to imitate the behavior of a massive number of subject-specific expert models, which are obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model on millions of image clusters mined from the Internet.
- They conduct extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, and demonstrate that SuTI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of quality, diversity, and efficiency. They also show that SuTI can generate novel images for unseen subjects and texts.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the overall framework of SuTI, which consists of three components: a **subject extractor**, a **subject-specific expert model**, and a **subject-driven apprentice model**.
- The subject extractor is a pretrained image classifier that can identify the main subject of an image and assign it to one of the predefined subject categories. The subject extractor is used to mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each containing images of the same subject category.
- The subject-specific expert model is a text-to-image model that can generate images conditioned on both text and subject style. The expert model is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model on each image cluster. The expert model can produce high-quality and customized images for a given subject, but requires optimization for each new subject.
- The subject-driven apprentice model is a text-to-image model that can generate images conditioned on text, subject style, and subject category. The apprentice model is trained by apprenticeship learning, where it learns to imitate the behavior of the expert models by observing their input-output pairs. The apprentice model can generate images for any subject without fine-tuning, by leveraging the subject category information as an additional input.
