Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a framework called **Prompt-Free Diffusion** that can generate new images from only visual inputs, without using any text prompts.
- **Why**: The paper aims to reduce the burden of text prompt engineering and searching for users who want to synthesize personalized images with a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. The paper also argues that text prompts are often ambiguous and insufficient to describe the desired image details, and that visual inputs can provide more comprehensive and precise control over the image generation process.
- **How**: The paper introduces a novel component called **Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder)** that replaces the conventional text encoder in a T2I diffusion model. SeeCoder takes a reference image as "context", an optional image structural conditioning (such as canny edge), and an initial noise as inputs, and encodes them into a latent representation that guides the diffusion process. SeeCoder is reusable and can be pre-trained in one T2I model and reused for another. The paper evaluates Prompt-Free Diffusion on various tasks such as natural image synthesis, anime figure generation, and virtual try-on, and compares it with prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches and state-of-the-art T2I models using text prompts. The paper shows that Prompt-Free Diffusion can achieve comparable or better results than the baselines, while offering more flexibility and convenience for users.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first reviews the background of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which are based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [25] and use a text encoder to condition the diffusion process on a text prompt. The paper also discusses the limitations of text prompts and the challenges of prompt engineering and searching.
- The paper then presents the proposed framework, Prompt-Free Diffusion, which takes only visual inputs to generate new images. The paper describes the three types of inputs: a reference image as "context", an optional image structural conditioning, and an initial noise. The paper also introduces the core component, Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder), which encodes the visual inputs into a latent representation that guides the diffusion process. The paper explains how SeeCoder is designed based on a transformer architecture [58] and how it can be pre-trained in one T2I model and reused for another.
- The paper then details the training and inference procedures of Prompt-Free Diffusion. The paper shows how to train SeeCoder with a pre-trained T2I diffuser using a contrastive loss [9] that encourages SeeCoder to produce similar latent representations for images that share the same semantics and appearance. The paper also shows how to perform inference with Prompt-Free Diffusion using an annealed Langevin dynamics [25] that samples new images from the learned distribution conditioned on the visual inputs.
- The paper then describes the experimental setup and evaluation metrics used to compare Prompt-Free Diffusion with prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches and state-of-the-art T2I models using text prompts. The paper also reports the results of ablation studies and qualitative analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of Prompt-Free Diffusion.
