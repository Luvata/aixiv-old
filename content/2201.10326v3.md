Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents ShapeFormer, a transformer-based network that produces a distribution of object completions, conditioned on incomplete, and possibly noisy, point clouds.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problem of shape completion from ambiguous partial inputs, which is challenging due to the uncertainty and diversity of possible completions. The paper also introduces a compact 3D representation that utilizes spatial sparsity to represent a close approximation of a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables.
- **How**: The paper proposes a novel architecture that consists of two main components: a vector quantized deep implicit function (VQ-DIF) encoder that maps an input point cloud to a discrete latent code, and a transformer decoder that generates a distribution of completions from the latent code. The paper also proposes a training scheme that encourages diversity and fidelity of the generated completions. The paper evaluates the proposed method on various shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans, and shows that it outperforms prior art in terms of both completion quality and diversity.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- A transformer-based network that produces a distribution of object completions from incomplete and noisy point clouds, which can be sampled to generate diverse and plausible completions.
- A compact 3D representation, vector quantized deep implicit function (VQ-DIF), that leverages spatial sparsity to encode a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables, which enables the use of transformers for 3D shape completion.
- A training scheme that combines reconstruction loss, diversity loss, and fidelity loss to encourage the network to generate high-quality and diverse completions that are faithful to the input.
- An extensive evaluation on various shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over prior art in terms of both completion quality and diversity.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a novel architecture that consists of two main components: a **VQ-DIF encoder** and a **transformer decoder**.
- The **VQ-DIF encoder** maps an input point cloud to a discrete latent code by applying a deep implicit function (DIF) network that predicts occupancy and feature values at query points, followed by a vector quantization (VQ) layer that discretizes the feature values into a finite set of codebook entries. The discrete latent code is then formed by concatenating the indices of the codebook entries corresponding to the occupied query points.
- The **transformer decoder** takes the discrete latent code as input and generates a distribution of completions by applying a series of self-attention and feed-forward layers. The output of the transformer decoder is a sequence of logits that represent the probabilities of selecting different codebook entries for each query point. The distribution of completions can then be sampled by choosing one codebook entry for each query point according to the logits, and reconstructing the 3D shape using a DIF network with the selected codebook entries as input features.
- The paper also proposes a training scheme that combines three types of losses: **reconstruction loss**, **diversity loss**, and **fidelity loss**. The reconstruction loss measures the similarity between the input point cloud and the reconstructed point cloud from the discrete latent code. The diversity loss encourages the network to produce diverse completions by maximizing the entropy of the logits. The fidelity loss penalizes the network for generating completions that deviate from the input point cloud in terms of shape and appearance.
