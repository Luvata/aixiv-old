Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for zero-shot image translation using a pre-trained text-image diffusion model and rich prompts. The method is called ReGeneration learning in an image-to-image Diffusion model (ReDiffuser).
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing text-to-image models, such as requiring precise and contextually relevant descriptions for image editing, and altering the shape of the original image content during the editing process.
- **How**: The paper introduces two novel components: cross-attention guidance based on regeneration learning, which enhances the expression of the target domain features while preserving the original shape of the image; and a cooperative update strategy, which improves the quality and consistency of shape preservation throughout the editing process. The paper also shows how to automatically discover the editing direction within the text embedding space without human prompting. The paper evaluates the proposed method on both real and synthetic image editing tasks and compares it with existing methods[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- A novel method for zero-shot image translation using a pre-trained text-image diffusion model and rich prompts, without requiring any additional training or human guidance.
- A cross-attention guidance mechanism based on regeneration learning, which enhances the expression of the target domain features while preserving the original shape of the image.
- A cooperative update strategy, which improves the quality and consistency of shape preservation throughout the editing process.
- Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic image editing tasks, showing that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of fidelity, diversity, and shape consistency.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper uses a pre-trained text-image diffusion model called LAION-5B [^1^][3] as the backbone for zero-shot image translation. The model takes a text prompt and a noise image as inputs and outputs a synthetic image that matches the text prompt.
- The paper introduces a regeneration learning framework that consists of two stages: regeneration and generation. In the regeneration stage, the paper uses the original image as the input noise and feeds it to the diffusion model with the original text prompt. The output of this stage is a regenerated image that preserves the content of the original image. In the generation stage, the paper uses the regenerated image as the input noise and feeds it to the diffusion model with a new text prompt. The output of this stage is a generated image that reflects the new text prompt while maintaining the shape of the original image.
- The paper proposes a cross-attention guidance mechanism based on regeneration learning, which leverages the attention maps of both the original and regenerated images to guide the generation process. The paper also introduces a cooperative update strategy, which updates the regenerated image with a weighted combination of itself and the generated image at each diffusion step, to improve the shape preservation quality and consistency.
- The paper shows how to automatically discover the editing direction within the text embedding space without human prompting, by using rich prompts that contain both source and target domain keywords. The paper also shows how to control the editing intensity by adjusting the distance between source and target prompts in the embedding space.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: original image x, original text prompt t1, new text prompt t2
# Output: generated image y

# Load the pre-trained text-image diffusion model LAION-5B
model = load_model("LAION-5B")

# Regeneration stage: use x as the input noise and t1 as the text prompt
x_reg = model(x, t1)

# Generation stage: use x_reg as the input noise and t2 as the text prompt
y = model(x_reg, t2)

# Cross-attention guidance: use the attention maps of x and x_reg to guide the generation process
for i in range(num_diffusion_steps):
  att_x = model.get_attention_map(x, t1, i) # get the attention map of x at step i
  att_x_reg = model.get_attention_map(x_reg, t1, i) # get the attention map of x_reg at step i
  att_y = model.get_attention_map(y, t2, i) # get the attention map of y at step i
  att_y = att_y * (att_x + att_x_reg) / 2 # update the attention map of y with a weighted average of att_x and att_x_reg
  y = model.update_image(y, t2, i, att_y) # update y with the new attention map at step i

# Cooperative update strategy: update x_reg with a weighted combination of itself and y at each diffusion step
for i in range(num_diffusion_steps):
  alpha = get_alpha(i) # get the weight coefficient at step i
  x_reg = alpha * x_reg + (1 - alpha) * y # update x_reg with a weighted combination of itself and y

# Return the final generated image y
return y
