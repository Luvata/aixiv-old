Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel training framework for cross-modal representation learning that uses progressive self-distillation and soft image-text alignments to learn robust representations from noisy web-harvested image captioning datasets[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of CLIP [63], which does not account for the noisy many-to-many correspondences between images and captions, and thus requires large amounts of data and compute to achieve good performance[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper introduces a method that distills its own knowledge to dynamically generate soft-alignment targets for a subset of images and captions in every minibatch, which are then used to update its parameters using cross-modal contrastive learning[^1^][1]. The paper evaluates its method on 14 benchmark datasets and shows that it outperforms CLIP in zero-shot classification, linear probe transfer, and image-text retrieval, without incurring extra computational cost[^1^][1]. The paper also shows that its method offers better effective robustness to natural distribution shifts compared to both ImageNet-trained models and CLIP itself[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper adopts the same model architecture as CLIP [63], which consists of a vision encoder and a language encoder that map images and captions to a joint embedding space[^1^][2].
- The paper modifies the training objective of CLIP [63], which uses a temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss to maximize the similarity between matched image-text pairs and minimize the similarity between unmatched pairs[^1^][2].
- The paper introduces a progressive self-distillation mechanism that leverages the model's own knowledge to generate soft-alignment targets for a subset of images and captions in every minibatch[^1^][2]. These targets are distributions over the similarity scores between each image and all captions in the minibatch, and vice versa[^1^][2].
- The paper uses these soft-alignment targets to update the model's parameters using a cross-modal contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations that are aligned with the targets[^1^][2]. The paper also applies a regularization term to prevent the model from overfitting to the targets[^1^][2].
- The paper progressively increases the size of the subset of images and captions that are used to generate the soft-alignment targets, starting from a small fraction and gradually reaching 100% of the minibatch[^1^][2]. This allows the model to gradually adapt to more challenging and diverse samples as it learns[^1^][2].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Initialize the model parameters
model = CLIP()
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters())

# Define the hyperparameters
batch_size = 256
temperature = 0.07
alpha = 0.5 # regularization coefficient
beta = 0.1 # initial fraction of samples for self-distillation

# Loop over the training data
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in data_loader:
    # Get the images and captions from the batch
    images, captions = batch

    # Compute the image and text embeddings using the model
    image_embeddings = model.encode_image(images)
    text_embeddings = model.encode_text(captions)

    # Compute the similarity scores between all image-text pairs
    similarity_scores = image_embeddings @ text_embeddings.T / temperature

    # Select a subset of samples for self-distillation
    subset_size = int(beta * batch_size)
    subset_indices = random.sample(range(batch_size), subset_size)

    # Generate the soft-alignment targets using the model's own knowledge
    targets = softmax(similarity_scores[subset_indices, :])

    # Compute the cross-modal contrastive loss using the targets
    loss = cross_entropy(similarity_scores[subset_indices, :], targets)

    # Add a regularization term to prevent overfitting to the targets
    loss += alpha * entropy(targets)

    # Update the model parameters using the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

  # Increase the fraction of samples for self-distillation
  beta = min(beta + 0.1, 1.0)
```
