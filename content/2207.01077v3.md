Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to apply CLIP for zero-shot monocular depth estimation, named DepthCLIP[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to transfer semantic knowledge learned from CLIP into more intricate tasks of quantified targets, such as depth estimation with geometric information[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper found that the patches of the input image could respond to a certain semantic distance token and then be projected to a quantified depth bin for coarse estimation[^1^][1]. The paper also compared DepthCLIP with existing unsupervised and supervised methods and showed its advantages[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper proposes a novel method to apply CLIP for zero-shot monocular depth estimation, named DepthCLIP, which requires no extra training and directly transfers semantic knowledge learned from CLIP into quantified depth bins[^1^][1].
- The paper demonstrates that DepthCLIP can achieve coarse depth estimation by finding the semantic distance tokens that correspond to the patches of the input image[^1^][1].
- The paper shows that DepthCLIP surpasses existing unsupervised methods and even approaches the early fully-supervised networks on several benchmark datasets[^1^][1].
- The paper is the first to conduct zero-shot adaptation from the semantic language knowledge to quantified downstream tasks and perform zero-shot monocular depth estimation[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper introduces the concept of semantic distance tokens, which are natural language phrases that describe the relative distance of an object from the camera, such as "very close", "far away", etc[^1^][2].
- The paper proposes a method to generate a set of semantic distance tokens for a given dataset by using the ground truth depth maps and clustering them into different depth bins[^1^][2].
- The paper uses CLIP to encode both the input image patches and the semantic distance tokens into a common feature space, and then computes the cosine similarity between them to obtain a coarse depth map[^1^][2].
- The paper applies a Gaussian filter and a bilinear interpolation to smooth and refine the coarse depth map[^1^][2].
- The paper evaluates the performance of DepthCLIP on several benchmark datasets, such as NYU Depth V2, KITTI, and Make3D, and compares it with existing unsupervised and supervised methods[^1^][2].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the semantic distance tokens
tokens = ["very close", "close", "medium", "far", "very far"]

# Load the pre-trained CLIP model
clip = load_clip_model()

# Load the input image
image = load_image()

# Split the image into patches
patches = split_image(image)

# Encode the patches and the tokens using CLIP
patch_features = clip.encode_image(patches)
token_features = clip.encode_text(tokens)

# Compute the cosine similarity between each patch and each token
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(patch_features, token_features)

# Assign each patch to the token with the highest similarity
depth_map = argmax(similarity_matrix, axis=1)

# Map each token to a quantified depth bin
depth_map = map_token_to_depth(depth_map)

# Apply a Gaussian filter and a bilinear interpolation to smooth and refine the depth map
depth_map = smooth_depth(depth_map)
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import torch
import torchvision
import clip
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Define the semantic distance tokens
tokens = ["very close", "close", "medium", "far", "very far"]

# Define the number of depth bins
num_bins = len(tokens)

# Define the patch size
patch_size = 32

# Load the pre-trained CLIP model
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)

# Load the input image and resize it to 224x224
image_path = "input.jpg"
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))

# Split the image into patches of size 32x32
patches = []
for i in range(0, 224, patch_size):
  for j in range(0, 224, patch_size):
    patch = image[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size]
    patches.append(patch)

# Convert the patches and the tokens to tensors
patches = torch.tensor(patches).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).to(device)
tokens = clip.tokenize(tokens).to(device)

# Encode the patches and the tokens using CLIP
with torch.no_grad():
  patch_features = model.encode_image(patches)
  token_features = model.encode_text(tokens)

# Compute the cosine similarity between each patch and each token
similarity_matrix = torch.matmul(patch_features, token_features.T)

# Assign each patch to the token with the highest similarity
depth_map = torch.argmax(similarity_matrix, dim=1)

# Map each token to a quantified depth bin using the inverse of the index
depth_map = num_bins - depth_map

# Reshape the depth map to a 7x7 matrix
depth_map = depth_map.reshape(7, 7)

# Apply a Gaussian filter and a bilinear interpolation to smooth and refine the depth map
depth_map = cv2.GaussianBlur(depth_map.numpy(), (3, 3), sigmaX=0.5)
depth_map = cv2.resize(depth_map, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
