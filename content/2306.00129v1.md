Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for 3D pose estimation of novel objects using self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs).
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the general applicability of pose estimators by using deep template matching strategies that can handle novel objects, clutter, occlusion and object symmetries.
- **How**: The paper trains ViTs and CNNs using contrastive learning to match training images against rendered templates of isolated objects. At test time, the paper uses masked cosine similarity to match query images against templates and retrieve object class and pose. The paper compares the performance of ViTs and CNNs on two datasets and shows that ViTs improve in matching accuracy and do not need fine-tuning in some cases.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- The first evaluation and comparison of self-supervised ViTs and CNNs for deep template matching for 3D pose estimation of novel objects.
- A novel masked cosine similarity metric that allows to compare query images and templates while ignoring irrelevant regions.
- A comprehensive analysis of the effects of network architecture, optimization and pre-training on the performance of ViTs and CNNs for deep template matching.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper uses a **self-supervised contrastive learning** framework to train ViTs and CNNs to match training images against rendered templates of isolated objects. The paper uses **SimCLR**  as the base method and adapts it for 3D pose estimation.
- The paper uses **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**  and **ResNet-50**  as the backbone networks for feature extraction. The paper compares different variants of ViTs with different patch sizes, depths and pre-training strategies. The paper also compares different optimization methods for ViTs and CNNs, such as AdamW , LARS  and SGD .
- The paper uses a **masked cosine similarity** metric to compare query images and templates while ignoring irrelevant regions. The paper masks out the background pixels of the query images and the non-object pixels of the templates using a simple thresholding technique. The paper computes the cosine similarity between the masked features of the query image and each template and selects the template with the highest similarity as the match.
- The paper evaluates the performance of ViTs and CNNs on two datasets: **LineMOD**  and **YCB-Video** . The paper uses two metrics: **Average Distance Error (ADD)**  and **Average Symmetry Distance Error (ADD-S)** . The paper also analyzes the impact of different factors on the performance, such as object symmetries, occlusion levels, clutter levels and object categories.
