Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for zero-shot video editing using off-the-shelf image diffusion models, which can generate and edit videos based on text descriptions without any video training data[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- **Why**: The paper aims to extend the success of text-to-image diffusion models to video editing, which is a challenging and useful task that requires temporal consistency, text-to-video alignment, and fidelity to the original video[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- **How**: The paper introduces three key modules: a null-text inversion module that finds the latent code of the original video frame given a null text; a cross-frame modeling module that leverages the attention mechanism to model temporal dependencies between frames; and a spatial regularization module that preserves the spatial details of the original video[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several video editing tasks, such as changing attributes, subjects, places, etc., and shows promising results compared to existing methods[^1^][1] [^2^][2].

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section:

- The paper adopts the text-to-image diffusion model proposed by Dhariwal et al. (2021), which can generate realistic images from text descriptions using a diffusion process that starts from a noisy image and gradually refines it to match the text .
- The paper extends this model to video editing by treating each video frame as an image and applying the diffusion model to each frame independently. However, this naive approach suffers from several issues, such as misalignment between text and video, lack of temporal consistency, and loss of spatial details .
- To address these issues, the paper introduces three key modules: a null-text inversion module, a cross-frame modeling module, and a spatial regularization module .
- The null-text inversion module aims to find the latent code of the original video frame given a null text, which is a special token that indicates no change. This module allows the model to align the text descriptions with the video frames and avoid generating irrelevant or inconsistent content .
- The cross-frame modeling module leverages the attention mechanism of the diffusion model to model temporal dependencies between frames. Specifically, the paper uses bi-directional attention to allow each frame to attend to both past and future frames during the diffusion process. This module improves the temporal consistency of the edited videos and reduces flickering or jittering artifacts .
- The spatial regularization module incorporates a spatial loss function that penalizes the difference between the original and edited frames in terms of pixel values and gradients. This module preserves the spatial details of the original video and avoids blurry or distorted results .

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a video V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_T} and a text description t
# Output: an edited video V' = {v'_1, v'_2, ..., v'_T}

# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model M
# Initialize a null text token n

# For each frame v_i in V:
  # Find the latent code z_i of v_i given n using the null-text inversion module
  # Generate a noisy image x_i from z_i using the diffusion model M
  # Refine x_i to match t using the diffusion model M
  # Apply the cross-frame modeling module to x_i using bi-directional attention
  # Apply the spatial regularization module to x_i using a spatial loss function
  # Set v'_i as x_i

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: a video V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_T} and a text description t
# Output: an edited video V' = {v'_1, v'_2, ..., v'_T}

# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model M
# Initialize a null text token n
# Initialize the number of diffusion steps N and the noise schedule beta
# Initialize the hyperparameters lambda_1 and lambda_2 for the spatial loss function

# For each frame v_i in V:
  # Find the latent code z_i of v_i given n using the null-text inversion module
    # Define a loss function L_inv(z_i) as the negative log-likelihood of v_i given z_i and n

    # Set x_i as sqrt(1 - beta_N) * z_i + sqrt(beta_N) * epsilon_i
  # Refine x_i to match t using the diffusion model M
    # For each diffusion step j from N to 1:
      # Compute the prediction error e_ij as x_ij - M(x_ij, t, j)
      # Sample epsilon_ij from a standard normal distribution
      # Set x_i(j-1) as (x_ij - sqrt(beta_j) * epsilon_ij + e_ij) / sqrt(1 - beta_j)
  # Apply the cross-frame modeling module to x_i using bi-directional attention
    # For each diffusion step j from N to 1:
      # Compute the attention weights w_ij(k) for each frame k in V using a softmax function
      # Set x_ij as w_ij(i) * x_ij + sum(w_ij(k) * x_kj for k != i)
  # Apply the spatial regularization module to x_i using a spatial loss function
    # For each diffusion step j from N to 1:
      # Compute the pixel loss L_pix(x_ij, v_i) as the mean squared error between x_ij and v_i
      # Compute the gradient loss L_grad(x_ij, v_i) as the mean squared error between the gradients of x_ij and v_i
      # Compute the total loss L_spat(x_ij, v_i) as lambda_1 * L_pix(x_ij, v_i) + lambda_2 * L_grad(x_ij, v_i)
      # Update x_ij using gradient descent to minimize L_spat(x_ij, v_i)
  # Set v'_i as x_i0

# Return V' as the edited video
