Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called **RealFusion** that can generate a full **360° reconstruction** of any object from a single image of it.
- **Why**: The paper aims to solve the challenging problem of **monocular 3D reconstruction** of objects, which is severely ill-posed due to the lack of information in a single image. The paper leverages the recent advances in **diffusion-based 2D image generators** that can synthesize realistic and diverse images from various inputs.
- **How**: The paper uses an existing diffusion model to create a **prompt** that causes it to "dream up" novel views of the object from the given image. The paper then extracts a **neural radiance field** from the original image and the diffusion model-based prior, thereby reconstructing the object in full. The paper also uses an approach inspired by **DreamFields** and **DreamFusion** to fuse the input view, the conditional prior, and other regularizers in a final, consistent reconstruction.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel method for 360° reconstruction of any object from a single image**, which leverages a diffusion-based 2D image generator to synthesize novel views of the object and a neural radiance field to reconstruct the object in full.
- **A new prompt design for diffusion models** that encourages them to "dream up" realistic and diverse views of the object from the given image, without requiring any additional supervision or data.
- **A state-of-the-art performance on benchmark images** for monocular 3D reconstruction of objects, compared to prior methods that use either neural radiance fields or other 3D representations.
- **A qualitative evaluation of the reconstructions** that shows a faithful match of the input view and a plausible extrapolation of the appearance and 3D shape of the object, including to the side of the object not visible in the image.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the **neural radiance field (NeRF)** model, which represents a 3D scene as a continuous function that maps a 3D location and a viewing direction to a color and a density value. The paper also reviews the **diffusion-based 2D image generator** model, which can synthesize realistic images from various inputs by reversing a diffusion process that gradually corrupts an image with noise.
- The paper then describes how to use the diffusion model to create a **prompt** for generating novel views of the object from the given image. The prompt consists of four components: the original image, a mask indicating the object region, a random noise image, and a target view angle. The paper shows how to combine these components into a single input for the diffusion model, and how to adjust the noise level and the view angle to control the diversity and realism of the generated views.
- The paper then explains how to fit a NeRF model to the given image and the generated views using an approach inspired by **DreamFields** and **DreamFusion**. The paper uses a loss function that balances the fidelity of the NeRF model to the input view, the consistency of the NeRF model with the diffusion prior, and the smoothness and sparsity of the NeRF model. The paper also uses a regularization term that penalizes unrealistic colors and densities in the NeRF model.
- The paper finally presents how to render the 360° reconstruction of the object from the fitted NeRF model using ray marching. The paper also shows how to apply texture mapping and shading to enhance the visual quality of the reconstruction.
