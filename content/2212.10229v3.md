Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes new efficient and lightweight parameterizations of StyleGAN for domain adaptation, which is the problem of fine-tuning a GAN model pretrained on a large dataset to a specific domain with few samples.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide a systematic and in-depth analysis of the domain adaptation problem of GANs, focusing on the StyleGAN model, and to answer some important questions that remain unanswered, such as which parts of StyleGAN are responsible for adapting to a new domain and how to reduce them further.
- **How**: The paper performs a detailed exploration of the most important parts of StyleGAN that are responsible for adapting the generator to a new domain depending on the similarity between the source and target domains. As a result, it proposes new parameterizations of StyleGAN for domain adaptation: StyleDomain directions for similar domains and Affine and AffineLight parameterizations for dissimilar domains. It also examines StyleDomain directions and discovers their many surprising properties that it applies for domain mixing and cross-domain image morphing.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first reviews the StyleGAN architecture and introduces some notations and definitions related to StyleSpace, which is the space of latent codes that control the style of the generated images.
- The paper then proposes two types of parameterizations of StyleGAN for domain adaptation: StyleDomain directions and Affine parameterizations.
- StyleDomain directions are directions in StyleSpace that capture the domain-specific features of the target domain. They are obtained by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the latent codes of the target samples. The paper shows that there exist a small number of StyleDomain directions that are sufficient for adapting to similar domains, and they can be further reduced by applying PCA again or by using a linear classifier.
- Affine parameterizations are affine transformations applied to the latent codes of the source domain to map them to the target domain. They consist of a scaling matrix and a bias vector that are learned by minimizing a reconstruction loss between the generated images and the target samples. The paper proposes two variants of Affine parameterizations: Affine and AffineLight. Affine applies the affine transformation to all layers of StyleGAN, while AffineLight applies it only to a subset of layers that are selected by a layer importance score.
- The paper also analyzes the properties of StyleDomain directions and shows that they can be used for domain mixing and cross-domain image morphing applications. Domain mixing is the process of combining features from different domains to create new domains, while cross-domain image morphing is the process of transforming an image from one domain to another by interpolating between their latent codes.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
# Input: a StyleGAN model pretrained on a source domain, a set of target samples from a target domain
# Output: a StyleGAN model adapted to the target domain

# Step 1: Compute the latent codes of the target samples using the pretrained StyleGAN model
target_latents = StyleGAN.encode(target_samples)

# Step 2: Choose a parameterization type based on the similarity between the source and target domains
if source and target domains are similar:
  # Use StyleDomain directions
  parameterization_type = "StyleDomain"
else:
  # Use Affine or AffineLight parameterizations
  parameterization_type = "Affine" or "AffineLight"

# Step 3: Learn the parameters for the chosen parameterization type
if parameterization_type == "StyleDomain":
  # Apply PCA to the target latent codes to obtain StyleDomain directions
  style_domain_directions = PCA(target_latents)
  # Optionally, reduce the number of StyleDomain directions by applying PCA again or using a linear classifier
  style_domain_directions = PCA(style_domain_directions) or LinearClassifier(style_domain_directions)
elif parameterization_type == "Affine":
  # Initialize a scaling matrix and a bias vector randomly
  scaling_matrix = RandomMatrix()
  bias_vector = RandomVector()
  # Minimize the reconstruction loss between the generated images and the target samples by updating the scaling matrix and bias vector
  for epoch in epochs:
    generated_images = StyleGAN.generate(scaling_matrix * source_latents + bias_vector)
    reconstruction_loss = Loss(generated_images, target_samples)
    scaling_matrix, bias_vector = Update(scaling_matrix, bias_vector, reconstruction_loss)
elif parameterization_type == "AffineLight":
  # Compute the layer importance score for each layer of StyleGAN based on the variance of the target latent codes
  layer_importance_score = Variance(target_latents)
  # Select a subset of layers with high layer importance score
  selected_layers = Select(layer_importance_score)
  # Initialize a scaling matrix and a bias vector randomly for each selected layer
  scaling_matrix = RandomMatrix(selected_layers)
  bias_vector = RandomVector(selected_layers)
  # Minimize the reconstruction loss between the generated images and the target samples by updating the scaling matrix and bias vector for each selected layer
  for epoch in epochs:
    generated_images = StyleGAN.generate(source_latents, scaling_matrix, bias_vector, selected_layers)
    reconstruction_loss = Loss(generated_images, target_samples)
    scaling_matrix, bias_vector = Update(scaling_matrix, bias_vector, reconstruction_loss, selected_layers)

# Step 4: Return the adapted StyleGAN model with the learned parameters
return StyleGAN(parameterization_type, style_domain_directions or scaling_matrix, bias_vector or None, selected_layers or None)
