Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for generic image manipulation from text prompts using latent diffusion models (LDM).
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text guided manipulation techniques that are restricted to specific classes of images, require fine-tuning, or expensive optimization.
- **How**: The paper exploits LDM for text to image generation to achieve zero-shot text guided manipulation. The paper employs a deterministic forward diffusion in a lower dimensional latent space, and the desired manipulation is achieved by simply providing the target text to condition the reverse diffusion process. The paper refers to this approach as LDEdit. The paper demonstrates the applicability of LDEdit on semantic image manipulation and artistic style transfer. The paper shows that LDEdit can accomplish image manipulation on diverse domains and enables editing multiple attributes in a straightforward fashion. The paper compares LDEdit with competing baselines and shows its benefits.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)**: The paper reviews the basics of LDM, which are generative models that learn to reconstruct an image from a series of noisy versions by applying a reverse diffusion process conditioned on a text prompt. The paper uses a pretrained LDM on a large-scale image dataset for text to image generation.
- **Text Guided Image Manipulation with LDM**: The paper introduces the main idea of LDEdit, which is to use LDM for text guided image manipulation. The paper describes how to perform a deterministic forward diffusion on an input image to obtain a latent code, and then use the target text to condition the reverse diffusion process to generate the manipulated image. The paper also explains how to handle multiple text prompts and multiple input images using LDEdit.
- **Implementation Details**: The paper provides the details of the LDM architecture, the text encoder, the training procedure, and the hyperparameters used in LDEdit. The paper also describes the datasets and evaluation metrics used in the experiments.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for LDEdit:

```python
# Input: an image x, a source text s, and a target text t
# Output: a manipulated image y

# Pretrained LDM and text encoder
ldm = load_pretrained_ldm()
text_encoder = load_pretrained_text_encoder()

# Forward diffusion
z = ldm.forward_diffuse(x)

# Reverse diffusion
y = ldm.reverse_diffuse(z, t)

# Return the manipulated image
return y
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code for LDEdit:

```python
# Input: an image x, a source text s, and a target text t
# Output: a manipulated image y

# Pretrained LDM and text encoder
ldm = load_pretrained_ldm()
text_encoder = load_pretrained_text_encoder()

# Number of diffusion steps
T = ldm.T

# Forward diffusion
z = x
for i in range(1, T+1):
  # Compute the noise level and the noise term
  beta_i = ldm.beta(i)
  epsilon_i = sqrt(beta_i) * random_normal()
  
  # Compute the prediction network output
  h_s = text_encoder(s)
  p_i = ldm.predict(z, h_s, i)
  
  # Apply the forward diffusion update
  z = (z - p_i) / sqrt(1 - beta_i) + epsilon_i

# Reverse diffusion
y = z
for i in range(T, 0, -1):
  # Compute the noise level and the noise term
  beta_i = ldm.beta(i)
  epsilon_i = sqrt(beta_i) * random_normal()
  
  # Compute the prediction network output
  h_t = text_encoder(t)
  p_i = ldm.predict(y, h_t, i)
  
  # Apply the reverse diffusion update
  y = sqrt(1 - beta_i) * (y - epsilon_i) + p_i

# Return the manipulated image
return y
