Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes Socratic Models (SMs), a framework for composing zero-shot multimodal reasoning with language by using multiple pretrained models and external modules.
- **Why**: The paper argues that different pretrained models have complementary forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains, such as visual-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LMs). By using language as an intermediate representation, these models can communicate with each other and perform joint inference on new tasks without additional training or finetuning.
- **How**: The paper demonstrates SMs on various applications, such as image captioning, video-to-text retrieval, egocentric video question answering, multimodal assistive dialogue, and robot perception and planning. The paper shows how to formulate these tasks as a language-based exchange between pretrained models and other modules, such as web search or robot actions. The paper also evaluates SMs against state-of-the-art baselines and ablations.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A modular framework for composing zero-shot multimodal reasoning with language by using multiple pretrained models and external modules, called Socratic Models (SMs).
- A set of novel applications that demonstrate the capabilities of SMs, such as egocentric video question answering, multimodal assistive dialogue, and robot perception and planning.
- An empirical evaluation of SMs on various tasks and datasets, showing that SMs are competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods and outperform ablations.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the general framework of Socratic Models (SMs), which consists of three main components: **input**, **output**, and **exchange**.
- The **input** is the multimodal data that is given to the SMs, such as images, videos, text, or speech. The input can be processed by different modules, such as visual-language models (VLMs), large language models (LMs), speech recognition systems, or optical character recognition systems.
- The **output** is the desired task-specific prediction that is generated by the SMs, such as a caption, a question, an answer, a dialogue, or a robot action. The output can be produced by different modules, such as text generation systems, text summarization systems, question answering systems, dialogue systems, or robot control systems.
- The **exchange** is the language-based communication between different modules that enables them to share information and perform joint inference on the output. The exchange can be formulated as a series of prompts and responses that are designed to elicit relevant information from each module and guide them towards the output. The exchange can also involve external modules, such as web search or robot sensors, that can provide additional information or capabilities to the SMs.
- The paper illustrates how to apply SMs to various applications by providing examples of input, output, and exchange for each task. The paper also discusses how to design effective prompts and responses for SMs by following some general principles and best practices.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the input, output, and exchange for the task
input = multimodal_data # e.g., images, videos, text, speech
output = task_specific_prediction # e.g., caption, question, answer, dialogue, action
exchange = language_based_communication # e.g., prompts and responses

# Define the modules that are involved in the SMs
modules = [VLM, LM, speech_recognition, OCR, text_generation, text_summarization, question_answering, dialogue_system, robot_control, web_search, robot_sensor]

# Process the input with the appropriate modules
for module in modules:
  if module.can_process(input):
    input = module.process(input)

# Generate the output with the appropriate modules
for module in modules:
  if module.can_generate(output):
    output = module.generate(output)

# Communicate between modules with the exchange
for prompt in exchange:
  # Select the best module to respond to the prompt
  best_module = None
  best_score = -inf
  for module in modules:
    score = module.score(prompt)
    if score > best_score:
      best_module = module
      best_score = score
  
  # Get the response from the best module
  response = best_module.respond(prompt)

  # Update the output with the response
  output = output.update(response)

# Return the output
return output
```
