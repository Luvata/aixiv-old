Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to fuse and align appearance, motion, and linguistic features for text-based video segmentation, which is a task of segmenting the object described by a sentence in a video sequence.
- **Why**: The paper argues that incorporating motion information from optical flow maps with appearance and linguistic modalities is crucial yet has been largely ignored by previous work, and that existing methods have limited interactions between visual and linguistic modalities and temporal information.
- **How**: The paper designs a multi-modal video transformer, which can fuse and aggregate multi-modal and temporal features between frames, a language-guided feature fusion module, which can progressively fuse appearance and motion features in each feature level with guidance from linguistic features, and a multi-modal alignment loss, which can alleviate the semantic gap between features from different modalities. The paper evaluates the proposed method on two datasets (A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences) and shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It is the first work to explore the explicit motion information from optical flow maps for text-based video segmentation.
- It proposes a multi-modal video transformer to fuse and aggregate multi-modal and temporal features between frames in a self-attention manner.
- It designs a language-guided feature fusion module to fuse appearance and motion features in each feature level with guidance from linguistic features.
- It introduces a multi-modal alignment loss to align features from different modalities and reduce the semantic gap.
- It achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections: problem formulation, multi-modal video transformer, language-guided feature fusion module, and multi-modal alignment loss. Here is a summary of each subsection:

- Problem formulation: The paper defines the text-based video segmentation task as a pixel-level classification problem, where the input is a video clip V and a sentence S, and the output is a segmentation mask M. The paper adopts a two-stage framework, where the first stage is to generate a coarse mask M0 using a backbone network and a cross-modal attention module, and the second stage is to refine the mask M using the proposed method.
- Multi-modal video transformer: The paper proposes a multi-modal video transformer (MMVT) to fuse and aggregate appearance, motion, and linguistic features between frames. The MMVT consists of three components: a multi-modal encoder, a temporal encoder, and a decoder. The multi-modal encoder takes the appearance features Xa, motion features Xm, and linguistic features Xl as inputs and outputs three sets of fused features Za, Zm, and Zl. The temporal encoder takes Za and Zm as inputs and outputs two sets of temporal features Ta and Tm. The decoder takes Ta, Tm, and Zl as inputs and outputs the refined mask M.
- Language-guided feature fusion module: The paper designs a language-guided feature fusion module (LGFF) to fuse appearance and motion features in each feature level with guidance from linguistic features. The LGFF consists of two sub-modules: a language-guided feature generation sub-module (LFG) and a feature fusion sub-module (FF). The LFG sub-module takes the appearance features Xa and linguistic features Xl as inputs and generates dynamic filters Fa using a convolutional layer and an attention layer. The FF sub-module takes Fa, Xa, and Xm as inputs and outputs fused features Y using element-wise multiplication and addition operations.
- Multi-modal alignment loss: The paper introduces a multi-modal alignment loss (MAL) to align features from different modalities and reduce the semantic gap. The MAL consists of two terms: a cross-modal alignment term (CMA) and a temporal alignment term (TA). The CMA term measures the similarity between appearance features Za and linguistic features Zl using cosine similarity. The TA term measures the consistency between appearance features Ta and motion features Tm using KL divergence. The MAL is added to the segmentation loss to optimize the model.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a video clip V and a sentence S
# Output: a segmentation mask M

# Extract appearance features Xa, motion features Xm, and linguistic features Xl from V and S using backbone networks
Xa, Xm, Xl = extract_features(V, S)

# Generate a coarse mask M0 using a cross-modal attention module
M0 = cross_modal_attention(Xa, Xl)

# Fuse and aggregate multi-modal and temporal features using a multi-modal video transformer
Za, Zm, Zl = multi_modal_encoder(Xa, Xm, Xl) # multi-modal encoder
Ta, Tm = temporal_encoder(Za, Zm) # temporal encoder
M = decoder(Ta, Tm, Zl) # decoder

# Refine the mask M using a language-guided feature fusion module
for each feature level i:
  Fa = language_guided_feature_generation(Xa[i], Xl) # language-guided feature generation sub-module
  Y = feature_fusion(Fa, Xa[i], Xm[i]) # feature fusion sub-module
  M = M + Y # fuse with the output of the decoder

# Compute the segmentation loss and the multi-modal alignment loss
L_seg = segmentation_loss(M, M0) # segmentation loss
L_mal = cross_modal_alignment(Za, Zl) + temporal_alignment(Ta, Tm) # multi-modal alignment loss

# Optimize the model parameters using gradient descent
L = L_seg + L_mal # total loss
update_parameters(L)
```
