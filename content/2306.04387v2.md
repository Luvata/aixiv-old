Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper introduces a large-scale dataset called M$^3$IT (Multi-Modal Multilingual Instruction Tuning) for optimizing vision-language models (VLMs) to align with human instructions across diverse tasks and languages.
- **Why**: The paper aims to advance instruction tuning research in the multi-modal domain, which has been limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction datasets. The paper also showcases the potential of a VLM model trained on M$^3$IT to answer complex questions, generalize to unseen tasks, and comprehend unseen instructions in different languages.
- **How**: The paper constructs M$^3$IT by curating 40 existing vision-language datasets, including 2.4 million instances and 400 manually written task instructions, reformatted into a vision-to-text structure. The paper also translates key tasks into 80 languages with an advanced translation system. The paper develops Ying-VLM, a VLM model based on ChatGPT and CLIP, and fine-tunes it on M$^3$IT. The paper evaluates Ying-VLM on various benchmarks and ablation studies, demonstrating its superior performance and generalization ability.[^1^][1]
