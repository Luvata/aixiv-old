Here is a summary of the method section:

```
The method section consists of four subsections: 3.1 Preliminaries, 3.2 DomainStudio, 3.3 Unconditional Few-Shot Image Generation, and 3.4 Conditional Domain-Driven Image Generation.

In 3.1 Preliminaries, the paper reviews the basics of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and their conditional variants.

In 3.2 DomainStudio, the paper introduces the proposed approach to fine-tune diffusion models for domain-driven image generation using limited data. The paper describes how to preserve the relative distances between adapted samples using a distance-preserving loss and how to enhance the learning of high-frequency details using a detail-enhancing loss.

In 3.3 Unconditional Few-Shot Image Generation, the paper applies DomainStudio to unconditional diffusion models and shows how to generate diverse images in target domains with few samples.

In 3.4 Conditional Domain-Driven Image Generation, the paper applies DomainStudio to conditional diffusion models and shows how to generate high-quality images in target domains conditioned on text or class labels.
