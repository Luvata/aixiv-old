Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel generative framework called **DiffuseVAE** that integrates **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** within a **diffusion model** framework[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing diffusion models and VAEs for image synthesis. Diffusion models can generate high-fidelity images but lack a low-dimensional and interpretable latent space and are slow at generation. VAEs have a low-dimensional latent space but suffer from poor sample quality[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper leverages the VAE inference network to obtain a low-dimensional latent code for each image, and uses this code to condition the diffusion model. The paper also designs novel conditional parameterizations for the diffusion model that are based on the latent code and the noise level. The paper shows that the proposed method can generate high-quality and diverse images from low-dimensional latents, and also enable controllable synthesis by manipulating the latents[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper introduces the **DiffuseVAE** framework, which consists of two components: a **VAE inference network** and a **diffusion model**[^1^][1].
- The VAE inference network takes an image x and encodes it into a low-dimensional latent code z using a Gaussian distribution q(z|x)[^1^][1].
- The diffusion model defines a Markov chain that transforms x into a noise variable x_0 by adding Gaussian noise at each step[^1^][1].
- The diffusion model also defines a reverse process that reconstructs x from x_0 by using a series of conditional distributions p(x_t|x_{t-1},z)[^1^][1].
- The paper proposes novel conditional parameterizations for p(x_t|x_{t-1},z) that are based on the latent code z and the noise level Î²_t[^1^][1].
- The paper trains the DiffuseVAE model by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the VAE and minimizing the reverse KL divergence between p(x_t|x_{t-1},z) and q(x_t|x,z)[^1^][1].
- The paper generates images from DiffuseVAE by sampling z from the prior p(z) and x_0 from the noise distribution p(x_0), and then running the reverse process[^1^][1].

# Define the VAE inference network
def q(z|x):
  # Encode x into a mean and log-variance vector
  mu, logvar = encoder(x)
  # Sample z from a Gaussian distribution
  z = mu + exp(logvar/2) * epsilon
  return z

# Define the diffusion model
def p(x_t|x_{t-1},z):
  # Compute the noise level
  beta_t = beta_schedule[t]
  # Compute the mean and variance of the conditional distribution
  mu_t, sigma_t = diffusion_model(x_{t-1}, z, beta_t)
  # Return the conditional distribution
  return Normal(mu_t, sigma_t)

# Train the DiffuseVAE model
def train(x):
  # Encode x into z using q(z|x)
  z = q(z|x)
  # Initialize x_0 by adding Gaussian noise to x
  x_0 = x + sqrt(1 - beta_0) * epsilon_0
  # Loop over the diffusion steps from T to 1
  for t in range(T, 0, -1):
    # Sample x_t from p(x_t|x_{t-1},z)
    x_t = p(x_t|x_{t-1},z).sample()
    # Compute the loss as the sum of the VAE ELBO and the reverse KL term
    loss += -log q(z|x) + log p(z) + KL(p(x_t|x_{t-1},z) || q(x_t|x,z))
  # Update the model parameters using gradient descent
  optimizer.step(loss)

# Generate images from DiffuseVAE
def generate():
  # Sample z from the prior p(z)
  z = p(z).sample()
  # Sample x_0 from the noise distribution p(x_0)
  x_0 = p(x_0).sample()
  # Loop over the diffusion steps from 1 to T
  for t in range(1, T+1):
    # Sample x_t from p(x_t|x_{t-1},z)
    x_t = p(x_t|x_{t-1},z).sample()
  # Return the final image x_T
  return x_T
