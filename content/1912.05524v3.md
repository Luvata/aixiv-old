Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a universal network architecture, called GLU-Net, for dense flow and correspondences between a pair of images. Dense flow and correspondences are important and general problems that cover geometric matching, optical flow and semantic correspondences.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing network architectures that are specialized for only one particular task and cannot generalize well to new scenarios or different applications. The paper also aims to achieve both high accuracy and robustness to large displacements, which are challenging for dense correspondence problems.
- **How**: The paper achieves its goals by investigating the combined use of global and local correlation layers, which compute local similarities between deep features extracted from the two images. The paper also proposes an adaptive resolution strategy, which allows the network to operate on virtually any input image resolution. The paper evaluates the proposed GLU-Net on three benchmarks: geometric matching, semantic matching and optical flow, and shows that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for all of them, using the same network and weights.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- The first universal network architecture for dense flow and correspondences that is directly applicable to geometric matching, optical flow and semantic correspondences, without any task-specific modifications or fine-tuning.
- A novel combination of global and local correlation layers that enables both high accuracy and robustness to large displacements.
- An adaptive resolution strategy that allows the network to handle virtually any input image resolution and scale.
- Extensive experiments on three benchmarks that demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed GLU-Net for all the tasks, using the same network and weights.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper describes the proposed GLU-Net architecture and its components. The paper first introduces the general framework of dense correspondence networks, which consists of three main modules: feature extraction, correlation computation and correspondence estimation. The paper then explains how GLU-Net differs from existing methods in each module. Specifically, GLU-Net uses a shared feature extractor that is trained end-to-end with the rest of the network, a global-local correlation layer that computes both global and local similarities between the features, and a multi-scale correspondence estimation module that predicts dense flow fields at different resolutions. The paper also details the adaptive resolution strategy that allows GLU-Net to handle images of arbitrary sizes and scales. The paper finally provides the implementation details and the training procedure of GLU-Net.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a pair of images I1 and I2
# Output: a dense flow field F between I1 and I2

# Define the feature extractor network
feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()

# Define the global-local correlation layer
correlation_layer = GlobalLocalCorrelationLayer()

# Define the correspondence estimation network
correspondence_estimator = CorrespondenceEstimator()

# Extract features from the input images
F1 = feature_extractor(I1)
F2 = feature_extractor(I2)

# Compute global and local correlations between the features
C = correlation_layer(F1, F2)

# Estimate dense flow fields at multiple scales
F = correspondence_estimator(C)

# Apply adaptive resolution strategy to handle different image sizes and scales
F = adaptive_resolution(F, I1, I2)

# Return the final dense flow field
return F
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: a pair of images I1 and I2
# Output: a dense flow field F between I1 and I2

# Define the feature extractor network
feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
# The feature extractor consists of a ResNet-50 backbone followed by a convolutional layer
# The backbone is initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights and the last two blocks are dilated
# The convolutional layer reduces the number of channels to 256 and applies ReLU activation

# Define the global-local correlation layer
correlation_layer = GlobalLocalCorrelationLayer()
# The global-local correlation layer computes the cosine similarity between every pair of feature vectors in F1 and F2
# The global correlation is computed at the original resolution of the features
# The local correlation is computed at a lower resolution by applying average pooling with a stride of 4
# The local correlation is then upsampled to match the global correlation resolution using bilinear interpolation
# The global and local correlations are concatenated along the channel dimension

# Define the correspondence estimation network
correspondence_estimator = CorrespondenceEstimator()
# The correspondence estimation network consists of four U-Net blocks, each predicting a dense flow field at a different scale
# Each U-Net block has an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections and convolutional layers
# The encoder downsamples the input by a factor of 2 at each level using strided convolutions
# The decoder upsamples the input by a factor of 2 at each level using transposed convolutions
# The skip connections concatenate the encoder and decoder features along the channel dimension
# The final layer of each U-Net block outputs a 2-channel flow field and applies a sigmoid activation
# The flow fields are normalized by multiplying them with the image width and height respectively
# The flow fields are refined by adding them to the warped versions of the previous scale flow fields using bilinear sampling

# Extract features from the input images
F1 = feature_extractor(I1)
F2 = feature_extractor(I2)

# Compute global and local correlations between the features
C = correlation_layer(F1, F2)

# Estimate dense flow fields at multiple scales
F = correspondence_estimator(C)

# Apply adaptive resolution strategy to handle different image sizes and scales
F = adaptive_resolution(F, I1, I2)
# The adaptive resolution strategy consists of three steps:
# 1. Resize the input images to have a maximum dimension of 1024 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio
# 2. Pad the resized images to have dimensions that are multiples of 64 pixels using zero-padding
# 3. Resize the final flow field to match the original input image size using bilinear interpolation

# Return the final dense flow field
return F
