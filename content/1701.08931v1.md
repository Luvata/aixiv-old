Here is a summary of the paper in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents a co-segmentation technique for space-time co-located image collections[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. Co-segmentation is the task of finding and extracting the common foreground object from a set of images.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenges of co-segmenting images that capture various dynamic events, usually by multiple photographers, and may contain multiple co-occurring objects that are not necessarily part of the intended foreground object[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. These ambiguities make traditional co-segmentation techniques ineffective.
- **How**: The paper introduces a weakly-supervised technique that assumes only a small seed, given in the form of a single segmented image[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The technique exploits the power of the entire set of images without building a global model, and progressively expands the foreground and background belief models across the entire collection[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The technique also uses local belief models that are propagated and reinforced with similar images[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The paper demonstrates that the technique outperforms previous co-segmentation techniques on challenging space-time co-located collections[^1^][1] [^2^][2].

According to the paper[^1^][1] [^2^][2], the main contributions are:

- **Formulating** the problem of co-segmentation for space-time co-located collections, which is a novel and challenging setting that has not been addressed before.
- **Introducing** a weakly-supervised technique that requires only a single segmented image as a seed, and exploits the power of the entire set of images without building a global model.
- **Proposing** a distributed approach that uses local belief models that are propagated and reinforced with similar images, and progressively expands the foreground and background belief models across the entire collection.
- **Demonstrating** that the technique outperforms previous co-segmentation techniques on challenging space-time co-located collections, including dense benchmark datasets that were adapted for the novel problem setting.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1] [^2^][2]:

- The method consists of three main steps: **seed selection**, **belief propagation**, and **belief expansion**.
- In the seed selection step, the user provides a single segmented image as a seed, which defines the common foreground object of interest. The seed image is used to initialize the foreground and background belief models, which are represented by histograms of color and texture features.
- In the belief propagation step, the technique iteratively selects a subset of images that are most similar to the current belief models, and updates the belief models with the segmentation results of these images. The segmentation is done by using graph cuts with unary and pairwise potentials that are derived from the belief models and the image features. The similarity between images and belief models is measured by using chi-squared distance and mutual information.
- In the belief expansion step, the technique progressively expands the belief models to cover more images in the collection, by using a greedy strategy that selects the most informative images at each iteration. The informativeness of an image is measured by its entropy reduction and its diversity from the previous images. The technique also updates the belief models with the segmentation results of the selected images, as in the belief propagation step.
- The method terminates when all images in the collection are segmented or when no more informative images can be found. The final output is a co-segmentation mask for each image in the collection.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```python
# Input: a collection of images I and a seed image S
# Output: a co-segmentation mask M for each image in I

# Initialize the foreground and background belief models F and B with the seed image S
F, B = initialize_belief_models(S)

# Initialize the set of segmented images J with the seed image S
J = {S}

# Initialize the set of unsegmented images U with the rest of the images in I
U = I - {S}

# Repeat until U is empty or no more informative images can be found
while U:

  # Select a subset of images K from U that are most similar to F and B
  K = select_similar_images(U, F, B)

  # For each image in K
  for image in K:

    # Segment the image using graph cuts with F and B as unary and pairwise potentials
    mask = segment_image(image, F, B)

    # Update F and B with the segmentation result of the image
    F, B = update_belief_models(F, B, image, mask)

    # Add the image and its mask to J
    J.add((image, mask))

    # Remove the image from U
    U.remove(image)

  # Select an informative image L from U that reduces entropy and increases diversity
  L = select_informative_image(U, F, B, J)

  # If no informative image can be found, break the loop
  if not L:
    break

  # Segment the informative image using graph cuts with F and B as unary and pairwise potentials
  mask = segment_image(L, F, B)

  # Update F and B with the segmentation result of the informative image
  F, B = update_belief_models(F, B, L, mask)

  # Add the informative image and its mask to J
  J.add((L, mask))

  # Remove the informative image from U
  U.remove(L)

# Return the co-segmentation masks M for each image in J
M = get_masks(J)
return M
```
