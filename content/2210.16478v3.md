Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel no-reference point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) metric named GPA-Net, which uses a graph convolutional network to extract features and perform quality regression, distortion type and degree predictions.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing no-reference PCQA metrics, which require preprocessing that introduces extra distortions, fail to capture effective distortion-related features, and do not consider the various distortion patterns and the invariance properties of PCQA.
- **How**: The paper introduces a new graph convolution kernel, GPAConv, which attentively captures the perturbation of structure and texture in point clouds. It also proposes a multi-task framework that leverages the correlation between quality regression and distortion type and degree predictions. Moreover, it proposes a coordinate normalization module that stabilizes the results of GPAConv under shift, scale and rotation transformations. The paper evaluates GPA-Net on two independent databases and shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art no-reference PCQA metrics.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper presents the details of GPA-Net, which consists of three modules: feature extraction, multi-task learning and coordinate normalization.
- The feature extraction module uses a graph convolutional network to encode the point cloud into a feature vector. The network consists of several graph convolution layers, each of which applies a new graph convolution kernel, GPAConv, to the point cloud. GPAConv uses an attention mechanism to learn the weights of the neighboring points based on their structure and texture similarity. The network also uses skip connections and global pooling to enhance the feature representation.
- The multi-task learning module consists of three tasks: quality regression, distortion type prediction and distortion degree prediction. The quality regression task uses a fully connected layer to map the feature vector to a quality score. The distortion type prediction task uses a softmax layer to classify the point cloud into one of the four distortion types: noise, quantization, simplification and smoothing. The distortion degree prediction task uses a sigmoid layer to estimate the distortion degree as a value between 0 and 1. The module uses a weighted sum of the mean squared error (MSE) for quality regression, the cross entropy (CE) for distortion type prediction and the binary cross entropy (BCE) for distortion degree prediction as the loss function.
- The coordinate normalization module aims to make GPAConv invariant to shift, scale and rotation transformations. It normalizes the coordinates of the point cloud by subtracting the mean, dividing by the standard deviation and applying a random rotation matrix. It also adds a small perturbation to avoid numerical instability.
