Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper presents **ODISE: Open-vocabulary DIffusion-based panoptic SEgmentation**, which unifies pre-trained text-image diffusion and discriminative models to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation.
- Why: The paper aims to address the problem of open-vocabulary recognition, which requires recognizing limitless categories of objects and scenes in the wild. Existing approaches based on text-image discriminative models are not optimal for scene-level structural understanding, while text-to-image diffusion models have the ability to generate high-quality images with diverse open-vocabulary language descriptions.
- How: The paper leverages the frozen internal representations of both text-image diffusion and discriminative models to perform panoptic segmentation. Specifically, it uses K-Means clustering of the diffusion model's internal representation to obtain semantically differentiated and localized information, and then uses a text-image discriminative model (CLIP) to assign open-vocabulary labels to each cluster. The paper also introduces a novel loss function that encourages consistent predictions across different scales and modalities.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel framework for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation** that unifies pre-trained text-image diffusion and discriminative models, and leverages their frozen internal representations to perform panoptic segmentation of any category in the wild.
- **A novel loss function** that encourages consistent predictions across different scales and modalities, and exploits the rich semantic information from text-image discriminative models.
- **Extensive experiments** on both open-vocabulary panoptic and semantic segmentation tasks, showing significant improvements over the previous state of the art on various datasets, such as ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Open Images V6, and Visual Genome.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes **ODISE: Open-vocabulary DIffusion-based panoptic SEgmentation**, which consists of three main components: a text-to-image diffusion model, a text-image discriminative model, and a panoptic segmentation head.
- The text-to-image diffusion model is a generative model that can synthesize realistic images from diverse open-vocabulary language descriptions. The paper uses a pre-trained diffusion model called DALL-E Mini [2], which is based on the diffusion probabilistic model [3] and the discrete variational autoencoder [4].
- The text-image discriminative model is a contrastive model that can classify images into open-vocabulary labels. The paper uses a pre-trained discriminative model called CLIP [5], which learns a joint embedding space for images and texts using a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs.
- The panoptic segmentation head is a module that performs panoptic segmentation using the frozen internal representations of both the diffusion and discriminative models. Specifically, it uses K-Means clustering of the diffusion model's internal representation to obtain semantically differentiated and localized information, and then uses CLIP to assign open-vocabulary labels to each cluster. The paper also introduces a novel loss function that encourages consistent predictions across different scales and modalities, and exploits the rich semantic information from CLIP.
