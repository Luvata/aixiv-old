## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called **SpectralCLIP** to prevent artifacts in text-guided style transfer from a spectral perspective[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper addresses the problem of undesirable artifacts (mainly written words and unrelated visual entities) that appear in the output images when using CLIP to guide the transfer of style from text descriptions[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper analyses the patch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder from the perspective of spectral analysis and finds that some frequency components are highly correlated to the presence of artifacts[^1^][1]. The paper then implements a spectral filtering layer on top of the CLIP vision encoder to filter out those components and reduce the artifacts[^1^][1]. The paper evaluates the proposed method on text-guided image style transfer and text-conditioned image generation tasks and shows that it prevents artifacts effectively without impairing the stylisation quality[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel spectral filtering layer** that can be applied on top of the CLIP vision encoder to filter out the frequency components that are correlated to the presence of artifacts in text-guided style transfer.
- **A comprehensive analysis** of the patch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder from the perspective of spectral analysis, revealing the entanglement of visual and written concepts and the correlation between frequency components and artifacts.
- **Extensive experiments** on text-guided image style transfer and text-conditioned image generation tasks, showing that SpectralCLIP prevents artifacts effectively without impairing the stylisation quality, and outperforms existing methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper first introduces the **preliminaries** of CLIP and text-guided image style transfer, and defines the problem of artifacts as the presence of written words or unrelated visual entities in the output images[^1^][1].
- The paper then presents the **spectral analysis** of the patch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder, and shows that different frequency components capture different levels of visual and linguistic information[^1^][1]. The paper also shows that the frequency components that are correlated to the presence of artifacts are mainly in the low and middle frequency ranges[^1^][1].
- The paper then proposes **SpectralCLIP**, a method that implements a spectral filtering layer on top of the CLIP vision encoder to filter out the frequency components that are correlated to the presence of artifacts[^1^][1]. The paper describes how to design the spectral filtering layer and how to integrate it with the existing text-guided image style transfer framework[^1^][1].
- The paper finally provides some **implementation details** and **ablation studies** to show the effectiveness and robustness of SpectralCLIP[^1^][1].
