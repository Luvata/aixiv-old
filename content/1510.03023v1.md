## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a technique for designing 3D-printed perforated lampshades, which project continuous grayscale images onto the surrounding walls.
- **Why**: The paper aims to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial detail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of the fabrication process.
- **How**: The paper computes a distribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of the light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse surface. The paper determines a suitable configuration of the tubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well as the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by computing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined density function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of each tessellation cell[^1^][1].

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- **A novel technique for designing 3D-printed perforated lampshades that project continuous grayscale images onto the surrounding walls**[^1^][1].
- **A method for computing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined density function, which determines the distribution and parameters of the tubes**[^1^][1].
- **A series of simulated images that are used to derive the density function for a particular target image**[^1^][1].
- **A set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed technique**[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper first defines the **problem formulation** and the **design constraints** for the perforated lampshades[^1^][1].
- The paper then introduces the **tube model**, which represents each hole as a thin tube with a radius and a tilt angle[^1^][1].
- The paper then describes how to compute the **density function**, which determines the distribution and parameters of the tubes over the lampshade surface[^1^][1].
- The paper then explains how to perform the **capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation**, which partitions the lampshade surface into cells, each containing a single tube[^1^][1].
- The paper then discusses how to **optimize** the tube parameters and the tessellation to improve the image quality[^1^][1].
- The paper then presents some **implementation details** and **fabrication considerations** for the 3D-printing process[^1^][1].
