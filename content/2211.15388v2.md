Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents Corgi, a novel method for text-to-image generation based on a shifted diffusion model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the image embedding generation from input text by leveraging the prior knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model in the diffusion process. The paper also explores semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation.
- **How**: The paper designs a new initialization distribution and a new transition step of the diffusion that encode the CLIP prior into the shifted diffusion model. The paper conducts extensive experiments on different datasets and evaluates the results in terms of quantitative measures and human evaluation. The paper also compares Corgi with existing methods such as DALL-E 2 and Lafite.

According to the paper at [^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **Proposing a shifted diffusion model** that encodes the CLIP prior into the diffusion process for text-to-image generation.
- **Improving the efficiency and effectiveness** of generating image embedding from text compared to the baseline diffusion model used in DALL-E 2.
- **Enabling semi-supervised and language-free training** for text-to-image generation, where only part or none of the images in the training dataset have an associated caption.
- **Achieving new state-of-the-art results** across different datasets on downstream language-free text-to-image generation tasks, outperforming the previous method, Lafite, by a large margin.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces the **shifted diffusion model**, which is a variant of the diffusion model that shifts the initialization distribution and the transition step of the diffusion process to encode the CLIP prior into the image embedding generation from text.
- The paper describes the **training procedure** of the shifted diffusion model, which consists of two stages: pre-training on a large-scale image dataset without captions, and fine-tuning on a smaller dataset with captions. The paper also explains how to use semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation.
- The paper presents the **generation procedure** of the shifted diffusion model, which involves sampling an image embedding from the shifted diffusion model conditioned on a text input, and then decoding it into an image using a pre-trained VQGAN model. The paper also discusses some techniques to improve the diversity and quality of the generated images.

    if t > 0:
      z_t_minus_1 = model.diffusion.sample_z(z_t, t, text)
  # Return the final image x_0
