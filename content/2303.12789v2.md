Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for editing 3D scenes with text-instructions, called Instruct-NeRF2NeRF. The method can modify a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) of a scene using natural language commands, such as "turn him into a clown" or "make him bald".
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of editing 3D scenes that are captured with neural 3D reconstruction techniques, such as NeRF. Traditional 3D editing tools are not suitable for neural representations, which often do not have explicit surfaces. The paper also argues that text-based instructions are more accessible and intuitive than manual sculpting or re-texturing.
- **How**: The paper uses an image-conditioned diffusion model (InstructPix2Pix) to iteratively edit the input images while optimizing the underlying scene. The method works as follows: (1) an image is rendered from the scene at a training viewpoint, (2) it is edited by InstructPix2Pix given a global text instruction, (3) the training dataset image is replaced with the edited image, and (4) the NeRF continues training as usual. The paper demonstrates that the method can edit large-scale, real-world scenes and accomplish more realistic, targeted edits than prior work.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- **A novel method for editing NeRF scenes with text-instructions**, which can handle both local and global edits, such as changing the appearance, shape, or style of objects in the scene.
- **A novel image-conditioned diffusion model (InstructPix2Pix)**, which can generate realistic and consistent image edits given a text instruction and a conditioning signal.
- **A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on large-scale, real-world scenes**, which shows that it outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, diversity, and fidelity of the edits.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the two main components of the proposed method: **InstructPix2Pix** and **NeRF2NeRF**.
- **InstructPix2Pix** is an image-conditioned diffusion model that can generate realistic image edits given a text instruction and a conditioning signal. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs, where the text describes an edit to be applied to the image. The model uses a diffusion process to gradually transform an input image into an output image that satisfies the instruction, while preserving the conditioning signal. The model can handle diverse types of edits, such as appearance, shape, style, and content changes.
- **NeRF2NeRF** is a framework that uses InstructPix2Pix to iteratively edit the input images while optimizing the underlying scene. The framework works as follows: (1) an image is rendered from the scene at a training viewpoint, (2) it is edited by InstructPix2Pix given a global text instruction, (3) the training dataset image is replaced with the edited image, and (4) the NeRF continues training as usual. The framework ensures that the edits are consistent across different viewpoints and lighting conditions, and that the NeRF scene is updated to reflect the edits.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a NeRF scene, a text instruction, and a collection of images used to reconstruct the scene
# Output: an edited NeRF scene that respects the text instruction

# Initialize InstructPix2Pix model with pre-trained weights
instruct_pix2pix = InstructPix2Pix()

# Initialize NeRF model with pre-trained weights
nerf = NeRF()

# Loop until convergence or maximum iterations
while not converged or max_iters:

  # Sample a random training viewpoint
  viewpoint = sample_viewpoint()

  # Render an image from the NeRF scene at the viewpoint
  image = nerf.render(viewpoint)

  # Edit the image using InstructPix2Pix given the text instruction and the viewpoint as conditioning signal
  edited_image = instruct_pix2pix.edit(image, instruction, viewpoint)

  # Replace the original image in the dataset with the edited image
  dataset[viewpoint] = edited_image

  # Update the NeRF scene using the edited dataset
  nerf.update(dataset)

# Return the edited NeRF scene
return nerf
```

# Define the hyperparameters
num_iters = 1000 # number of iterations for NeRF2NeRF
num_timesteps = 1000 # number of timesteps for InstructPix2Pix
beta1 = 0.9 # Adam optimizer parameter for NeRF
beta2 = 0.999 # Adam optimizer parameter for NeRF
lr = 5e-4 # learning rate for NeRF
sigma = 0.01 # noise level for InstructPix2Pix

# Initialize InstructPix2Pix model with pre-trained weights
instruct_pix2pix = InstructPix2Pix()

# Initialize NeRF model with pre-trained weights
nerf = NeRF()

# Initialize Adam optimizer for NeRF
optimizer = Adam(nerf.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, beta2))

# Loop for a fixed number of iterations
for i in range(num_iters):

  # Sample a random training viewpoint
  viewpoint = sample_viewpoint()

  # Render an image from the NeRF scene at the viewpoint
  image = nerf.render(viewpoint)

  # Add Gaussian noise to the image
  noisy_image = image + sigma * torch.randn_like(image)

  # Initialize the edited image as the noisy image
  edited_image = noisy_image

  # Loop for a fixed number of timesteps
  for t in range(num_timesteps):

    # Compute the timestep embedding using a sinusoidal function
    timestep_embedding = sin(2 * pi * t / num_timesteps)

    # Concatenate the text instruction, the viewpoint, and the timestep embedding as the conditioning signal
    conditioning_signal = torch.cat([instruction, viewpoint, timestep_embedding])

    # Predict the noise level and the diffusion coefficient using InstructPix2Pix given the conditioning signal
    noise_level, diffusion_coefficient = instruct_pix2pix.predict_noise_and_diffusion(conditioning_signal)

    # Apply the noise level and the diffusion coefficient to the edited image
    edited_image = (edited_image - noise_level * noisy_image) / (1 - noise_level)
    edited_image = edited_image + diffusion_coefficient * torch.randn_like(edited_image)

    # Predict the residual image using InstructPix2Pix given the edited image and the conditioning signal
    residual_image = instruct_pix2pix.predict_residual(edited_image, conditioning_signal)

    # Add the residual image to the edited image
    edited_image = edited_image + residual_image

  # Replace the original image in the dataset with the edited image
  dataset[viewpoint] = edited_image

  # Compute the loss function for NeRF using the negative log-likelihood of the pixels
  loss = -nerf.log_likelihood(dataset)

  # Update the NeRF scene using gradient descent
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Return the edited NeRF scene
return nerf
