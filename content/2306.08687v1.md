Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel method for interpolating between two seeds and defining centroids in the latent seed space of text-to-image diffusion models, which are generative models that can synthesize realistic images from natural language descriptions.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the issue that current training procedures make diffusion models biased toward inputs with a narrow range of norm values, which affects the generation of new and rare concepts. The paper also wants to improve the performance of diffusion models on few-shot and long-tail learning tasks, where data is scarce or imbalanced.
- **How**: The paper makes the observation that simple operations like interpolation and centroid finding work poorly with the standard Euclidean and spherical metrics in the latent space. The paper then introduces a new non-Euclidean metric that takes into account a norm-based prior on seeds, and describes an efficient algorithm for approximating this metric. The paper shows that the new metric significantly enhances the generation of rare concept images, and leads to state-of-the-art results on few-shot and long-tail benchmarks.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel method for interpolating between two seeds** in the latent space of text-to-image diffusion models, which defines a new non-Euclidean metric that takes into account a norm-based prior on seeds.
- **A simple yet efficient algorithm for approximating the new metric**, which can be used to further define centroids in the latent seed space and perform seed manipulation for image generation.
- **An extensive evaluation of the proposed method** on various text-to-image generation tasks, such as rare concept generation, few-shot learning, and long-tail learning, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of generation speed, image quality, and semantic content.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the **text-to-image diffusion model**, which is a generative model that takes a natural language description and a random seed as inputs, and synthesizes an image that matches the description through a series of diffusion steps. The paper also defines the **latent seed space** of the model, which is the space of possible seeds that can be used to generate images.
- The paper then presents the **norm-guided interpolation method**, which is a novel way of interpolating between two seeds in the latent seed space. The paper shows that the standard Euclidean and spherical metrics are not suitable for interpolation, as they ignore the norm distribution of the seeds. The paper proposes a new non-Euclidean metric that takes into account a norm-based prior on seeds, and shows that it leads to more diverse and realistic image generation.
- The paper also describes an **efficient algorithm for approximating the new metric**, which is based on solving a convex optimization problem. The paper shows that the algorithm can be easily implemented and integrated with existing text-to-image diffusion models, and that it has low computational cost and memory footprint.
- The paper further extends the **norm-guided interpolation method to define centroids** in the latent seed space, which are useful for generating images that represent multiple concepts or descriptions. The paper shows that the standard Euclidean and spherical metrics are also not suitable for centroid finding, as they produce blurry or unrealistic images. The paper proposes a new non-Euclidean metric that takes into account a norm-based prior on seeds, and shows that it leads to more sharp and semantic image generation.
