Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces a novel method for 3D acquisition and reconstruction of solid transparent objects using a static background with a coded pattern and differentiable tracing of refractive ray paths.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods for capturing the 3D geometry of transparent objects, which either involve a complex setup or suffer from over-smoothing and loss of fine detail.
- **How**: The paper establishes a mapping between the camera view rays and locations on the background, and then optimizes a 3D mesh approximation of the object using a gradient-based algorithm that ensures silhouette consistency and smoothness. The paper also demonstrates the accuracy and robustness of the method through extensive experiments and comparisons.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It proposes a novel and simple setup for 3D acquisition of transparent objects using a static background with a coded pattern.
- It introduces a differentiable tracing of refractive ray paths that allows for direct optimization of a 3D mesh approximation of the object using gradient-based methods.
- It presents a reconstruction algorithm that simultaneously ensures silhouette consistency and smoothness of the mesh.
- It shows the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments and comparisons.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The method consists of three main steps: **calibration**, **reconstruction**, and **refinement**.
- In the calibration step, the method uses a static background with a coded pattern to establish a mapping between the camera view rays and locations on the background. The method also estimates the refractive index of the object using a calibration object with known geometry and refractive index.
- In the reconstruction step, the method uses differentiable tracing of refractive ray paths to directly optimize a 3D mesh approximation of the object. The method defines an energy function that measures the discrepancy between the observed and predicted background locations, as well as the silhouette consistency and smoothness of the mesh. The method then minimizes the energy function using a gradient-based algorithm that exploits the differentiability of the ray tracing process.
- In the refinement step, the method further improves the quality of the mesh by applying a Laplacian smoothing operator and a normal correction scheme. The method also optionally performs a texture mapping step to transfer the color information from the background to the mesh.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a set of images of a transparent object with a static background
# Output: a 3D mesh of the object with optional texture mapping

# Calibration step
background = load_background_pattern()
calibration_object = load_calibration_object()
refractive_index = estimate_refractive_index(calibration_object)
ray_to_background = compute_ray_to_background_mapping(background)

# Reconstruction step
mesh = initialize_mesh()
energy = compute_energy(mesh, ray_to_background)
while not converged:
  gradient = compute_gradient(mesh, ray_to_background)
  mesh = update_mesh(mesh, gradient)
  energy = compute_energy(mesh, ray_to_background)

# Refinement step
mesh = smooth_mesh(mesh)
mesh = correct_mesh_normals(mesh)
if texture_mapping:
  mesh = transfer_texture(mesh, background)

# Return the final mesh
return mesh
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: a set of images of a transparent object with a static background
# Output: a 3D mesh of the object with optional texture mapping

# Calibration step
background = load_background_pattern() # load the image of the background pattern
calibration_object = load_calibration_object() # load the 3D model of the calibration object
refractive_index = estimate_refractive_index(calibration_object) # use a least-squares method to estimate the refractive index of the object from the observed distortion of the background pattern
ray_to_background = compute_ray_to_background_mapping(background) # for each pixel in the image, compute the corresponding location on the background pattern using a homography transformation

# Reconstruction step
mesh = initialize_mesh() # initialize a coarse mesh of the object using a bounding box or a convex hull
energy = compute_energy(mesh, ray_to_background) # compute the initial energy function that consists of three terms: data term, silhouette term, and smoothness term
while not converged:
  gradient = compute_gradient(mesh, ray_to_background) # compute the gradient of the energy function with respect to the mesh vertices using a differentiable ray tracing algorithm that accounts for refraction and reflection
  mesh = update_mesh(mesh, gradient) # update the mesh vertices using a gradient descent method with a line search or a trust region strategy
  energy = compute_energy(mesh, ray_to_background) # compute the updated energy function

# Refinement step
mesh = smooth_mesh(mesh) # apply a Laplacian smoothing operator to the mesh vertices to reduce noise and irregularities
mesh = correct_mesh_normals(mesh) # correct the mesh normals by flipping them if they point away from the camera or if they are inconsistent with neighboring normals
if texture_mapping:
  mesh = transfer_texture(mesh, background) # transfer the color information from the background pattern to the mesh faces using a barycentric interpolation or a nearest-neighbor method

# Return the final mesh
return mesh
