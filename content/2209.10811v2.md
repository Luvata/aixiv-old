Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new encoder training scheme for GANs, called IntereStyle, that focuses on encoding an interest region of a real-world image, such as a human face, while filtering out the uninterest region, such as the background or obstacles.
- **Why**: The paper argues that existing encoders of GANs suffer from a trade-off between distortion and perception, because they try to lower the distortion of the whole image, including the uninterest region, which may be out-of-distribution or interfere with the interest region. For example, a microphone overlapped with a facial region may be inverted into a white beard by the encoder.
- **How**: The paper introduces IntereStyle, which steers the encoder to disentangle the encodings of the interest and uninterest regions. To do this, IntereStyle iteratively filters out the information of the uninterest region using a mask and a style mixing operation. The paper shows that IntereStyle achieves both lower distortion and higher perceptual quality compared to existing state-of-the-art encoders, and demonstrates robust image editing and style mixing results.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It identifies the problem of existing encoders of GANs that try to lower the distortion of the whole image, including the uninterest region, which may degrade the perceptual quality and the feature preservation of the interest region.
- It proposes a novel encoder training scheme, IntereStyle, that encodes an interest region of a real-world image by filtering out the uninterest region iteratively.
- It demonstrates that IntereStyle outperforms existing state-of-the-art encoders in terms of distortion and perception metrics, and shows robust image editing and style mixing results on various datasets.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper describes the details of IntereStyle, which consists of three main components: an encoder network, a mask generator, and a style mixing operation. The encoder network takes a real-world image as input and outputs two latent codes: one for the interest region and one for the uninterest region. The mask generator predicts a binary mask that indicates the interest region of the image. The style mixing operation combines the two latent codes using the mask to generate a mixed latent code that is fed into the pre-trained StyleGAN generator. The paper defines a loss function that consists of four terms: a reconstruction loss, a perceptual loss, a style consistency loss, and a mask regularization loss. The paper also describes how to train IntereStyle in an end-to-end manner using a two-stage training strategy. The paper provides the implementation details and the hyperparameters of IntereStyle in the supplementary material.
