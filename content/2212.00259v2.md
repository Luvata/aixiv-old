Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper introduces a virtual benchmark, Super-CLEVR, to diagnose domain robustness in visual reasoning. It considers four factors of domain shift: visual complexity, question redundancy, concept distribution and concept compositionality. It also proposes a probabilistic neural symbolic VQA method (P-NSVQA) that outperforms existing methods on three of the four factors.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problem of domain generalization in VQA, which is challenging due to the multi-modal nature of the task and the intertwined factors of variation. The paper argues that existing benchmarks do not allow for a systematic analysis of the contributing factors in domain shifts, and that a virtual benchmark can isolate and control these factors.
- **How**: The paper uses a 3D rendering engine to generate synthetic images and questions for Super-CLEVR. It varies the four factors of domain shift by manipulating the scene complexity, question length, concept frequency and concept combination. It evaluates four existing VQA methods (NSCL, NSVQA, FiLM and mDETR) and its proposed P-NSVQA on Super-CLEVR. It shows that P-NSVQA achieves better performance and robustness by disentangling reasoning and perception, and by incorporating uncertainty reasoning.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It introduces Super-CLEVR, a virtual benchmark to diagnose domain robustness in visual reasoning, which allows for a fine-grained analysis of different factors of domain shift.
- It proposes P-NSVQA, a probabilistic neural symbolic VQA method that extends NSVQA with uncertainty reasoning, and shows that it outperforms existing methods on three of the four factors of domain shift.
- It provides insights into the effects of different factors of domain shift on VQA methods, and suggests that disentangling reasoning and perception, combined with probabilistic uncertainty, can improve domain robustness.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of three subsections:

- Super-CLEVR: A Virtual Benchmark for Domain Robustness. This subsection describes how the paper generates synthetic images and questions for Super-CLEVR using a 3D rendering engine. It also explains how the paper varies the four factors of domain shift (visual complexity, question redundancy, concept distribution and concept compositionality) by manipulating the scene complexity, question length, concept frequency and concept combination.
- Probabilistic Neural Symbolic VQA (P-NSVQA). This subsection introduces P-NSVQA, a probabilistic extension of NSVQA that incorporates uncertainty reasoning. It also describes how P-NSVQA performs perception, parsing, reasoning and answer generation using neural networks and probabilistic graphical models.
- Experiments. This subsection presents the experimental setup and results of the paper. It compares P-NSVQA with four existing VQA methods (NSCL, NSVQA, FiLM and mDETR) on Super-CLEVR under different domain shift scenarios. It also analyzes the performance and robustness of each method with respect to the four factors of domain shift.
