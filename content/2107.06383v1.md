Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper investigates how much CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained visual encoder, can benefit various vision-and-language tasks.

Why: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing visual encoders that rely on manually-annotated data and pre-defined class labels, and to explore the advantages of CLIP that learns visual concepts with language supervision from web-crawled data.

How: The paper proposes to use CLIP as the visual encoder in two scenarios: 1) plugging CLIP into task-specific fine-tuning; 2) combining CLIP with vision-and-language pre-training and transferring to downstream tasks. The paper evaluates CLIP on diverse vision-and-language tasks, such as visual question answering, visual entailment, and vision-and-language navigation, and compares it with widely-used visual encoders such as BottomUp-TopDown.

Here are some of the contributions of the paper:

```
- The paper is the first to systematically study the impact of CLIP as the visual encoder for various vision-and-language tasks.
- The paper proposes two scenarios to leverage CLIP for vision-and-language tasks: task-specific fine-tuning and vision-and-language pre-training.
- The paper shows that CLIP outperforms existing visual encoders trained on in-domain annotated data, such as BottomUp-TopDown, on diverse vision-and-language tasks.
- The paper establishes new state-of-the-art results on visual question answering, visual entailment, and vision-and-language navigation tasks using CLIP as the visual encoder.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The method section of the paper consists of three parts: 1) CLIP as the visual encoder; 2) task-specific fine-tuning with CLIP; and 3) vision-and-language pre-training with CLIP.

- In the first part, the paper introduces CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained visual encoder that learns visual concepts with language supervision from web-crawled data. The paper describes the architecture and training objective of CLIP, and how it can be used to extract visual features from images.
- In the second part, the paper proposes to plug CLIP into existing vision-and-language models and fine-tune them on specific tasks, such as visual question answering, visual entailment, and vision-and-language navigation. The paper explains how to adapt CLIP to different input and output formats, and how to optimize the model parameters.
- In the third part, the paper proposes to combine CLIP with vision-and-language pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs, such as Conceptual Captions. The paper shows how to pre-train a joint vision-and-language model with CLIP as the visual encoder and a transformer as the text encoder, using masked language modeling and image-text matching as the pre-training objectives. The paper also discusses how to transfer the pre-trained model to downstream tasks.

Here is a possible high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```
# Load CLIP as the visual encoder
clip = load_clip()

# For each vision-and-language task
for task in tasks:

  # Scenario 1: Task-specific fine-tuning with CLIP
  # Load the task-specific model and data
  model = load_model(task)
  data = load_data(task)

  # Adapt CLIP to the input and output format of the task
  clip = adapt_clip(clip, task)

  # Replace the visual encoder of the model with CLIP
  model.visual_encoder = clip

  # Fine-tune the model on the task data
  model = fine_tune(model, data)

  # Evaluate the model on the task
  evaluate(model, task)

  # Scenario 2: Vision-and-language pre-training with CLIP
  # Load the vision-and-language pre-training data
  data = load_pretrain_data()

  # Load a transformer as the text encoder
  transformer = load_transformer()

  # Pre-train a joint vision-and-language model with CLIP and transformer
  model = pre_train(clip, transformer, data)

  # Transfer the pre-trained model to the task
  model = transfer(model, task)

  # Evaluate the model on the task
  evaluate(model, task)
