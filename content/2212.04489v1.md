Here is a summary of the paper based on the abstract[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel method for single image editing with text-to-image diffusion models, which can generate realistic and diverse images based on natural language descriptions.
- **Why**: The paper addresses the problem of single image editing, which is challenging because existing methods either require multiple images of the same object or suffer from overfitting and information leakage when fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models with a single image.
- **How**: The paper introduces a model-based guidance that distills the knowledge from a model trained on a single image into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. The paper also proposes a patch-based fine-tuning that can help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel model-based guidance** that enables single image editing with text-to-image diffusion models by distilling the knowledge from a model trained on a single image into the pre-trained diffusion model.
- **A patch-based fine-tuning** that allows the model to generate images of arbitrary resolution by fine-tuning on patches of different sizes and locations.
- **Extensive experiments** that validate the design choices of the proposed approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

Here is a summary of the method section based on the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper adopts the **text-to-image diffusion model** proposed by Dhariwal et al. (2021), which is a generative model that can synthesize realistic images from natural language descriptions by reversing the diffusion process.
- The paper proposes a **model-based guidance** that consists of two components: a **classifier-free guidance** that computes the similarity between the generated image and the given image based on their feature maps, and a **model-based guidance** that distills the knowledge from a model trained on a single image into the pre-trained diffusion model by minimizing the KL divergence between their output distributions.
- The paper also proposes a **patch-based fine-tuning** that fine-tunes the pre-trained diffusion model on patches of different sizes and locations from the given image, which can help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution and avoid overfitting to a single image.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the text-to-image diffusion model
model = DiffusionModel(pretrained=True)

# Define the model-based guidance
mbg = ModelBasedGuidance(model)

# Define the patch-based fine-tuning
pbf = PatchBasedFineTuning(model)

# Given an image x and a text description t
x = load_image()
t = load_text()

# Fine-tune the model on patches of x
pbf.fine_tune(x)

# Generate an image y from t and x
y = model.generate(t, x, mbg)

# Display the generated image
show_image(y)
```
