Here is a summary of the paper based on the search results:

- **What**: The paper presents a method for face editing with attention, which can manipulate local facial attributes based on text descriptions by using the latent space of StyleGAN and CLIP[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing GAN-based face editing methods, which either rely on the perfect disentanglement of the latent space or require manual tuning of hyperparameters. The paper also wants to achieve disentangled and controllable face manipulations that only affect the intended regions.
- **How**: The paper builds on the StyleGAN generator and incorporates learned attention maps that serve as masks to guide a blending between the original and modified features. The paper also employs CLIP, which can provide guidance for the latent space edits based on text descriptions. The paper performs extensive experiments and shows qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over alternative methods.

Here is a summary of the method section based on the search results:

- The method consists of three main components: a **latent mapper**, an **attention module**, and a **text encoder**[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- The latent mapper takes an input image and a text description as inputs, and predicts an offset in the latent space of StyleGAN that can achieve the desired edit[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The latent mapper is trained with a reconstruction loss, an identity loss, and a CLIP loss[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- The attention module learns to generate attention maps that indicate the regions of interest for the edit based on the text description[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The attention maps are used to mask the features of StyleGAN and blend them with the modified features[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The attention module is trained with an attention loss and a CLIP loss[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- The text encoder is based on CLIP, which can encode text descriptions into high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the text[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The text encoder provides guidance for both the latent mapper and the attention module by computing the CLIP loss, which measures the similarity between the text and the image features[^1^][1] [^2^][2].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: an image x and a text description t
# Output: an edited image y

# Load the pretrained StyleGAN generator G and CLIP text encoder E
G = load_stylegan()
E = load_clip()

# Initialize the latent mapper M and the attention module A
M = LatentMapper()
A = AttentionModule()

# Encode the text description into a vector v
v = E(t)

# Predict an offset delta in the latent space of G based on x and v
delta = M(x, v)

# Generate an intermediate image z by adding delta to the latent code of x
z = G(G.inverse(x) + delta)

# Generate an attention map m based on x and v
m = A(x, v)

# Blend the features of x and z using m to obtain the final image y
y = G(m * G.inverse(x) + (1 - m) * G.inverse(z))
```
