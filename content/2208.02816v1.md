Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to adapt pretrained language-image models to video recognition tasks without pretraining a new model from scratch.
- **Why**: The paper aims to leverage the power of contrastive language-image pretraining, which has shown great success in learning visual-textual joint representation from web-scale data and achieving zero-shot generalization for various image tasks, to video domains, which is still an open problem.
- **How**: The paper introduces two main components: a cross-frame attention mechanism that captures the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal dimension and exchanges information across frames, and a video-specific prompting scheme that uses video content information to generate discriminative textual prompts. The paper evaluates the proposed method on different video recognition scenarios, such as fully-supervised, zero-shot, and few-shot settings, and shows that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It presents a simple yet effective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video recognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch.
- It proposes a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly exchanges information across frames and can be plugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly.
- It proposes a video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information for generating discriminative textual prompts.
- It demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed approach on different video recognition scenarios, such as fully-supervised, zero-shot, and few-shot settings, and achieves state-of-the-art results on Kinectics-400 dataset.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section of the above paper:

- The paper adopts the CLIP [35] model as the backbone for video recognition, which consists of a vision encoder and a text encoder. The vision encoder takes a sequence of frames as input and outputs a visual feature vector. The text encoder takes a textual prompt as input and outputs a textual feature vector. The similarity between the visual and textual feature vectors is computed by cosine similarity and used for training and inference.
- The paper introduces a cross-frame attention mechanism that enhances the vision encoder with temporal information. The cross-frame attention mechanism consists of two parts: a temporal projection layer and a cross-frame attention layer. The temporal projection layer projects the frame features into a lower-dimensional space to reduce the computational cost. The cross-frame attention layer computes the attention weights between each pair of frames and updates the frame features by aggregating information from other frames.
- The paper introduces a video-specific prompting scheme that generates textual prompts for video recognition. The video-specific prompting scheme consists of two parts: a video content extractor and a prompt generator. The video content extractor extracts key information from the video, such as objects, actions, scenes, and attributes. The prompt generator uses templates and rules to combine the extracted information into natural language sentences that describe the video content. The generated prompts are used as input for the text encoder.

  # Apply the cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance the frame features with temporal information
  frames = cross_frame_attention(frames)
  # Generate a textual prompt for the video using the video-specific prompting scheme
  prompt = video_specific_prompting(video)
  # Encode the frame features and the prompt features using the CLIP model
