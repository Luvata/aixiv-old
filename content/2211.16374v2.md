Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel method for domain adaptation of 3D generative models using text-to-image diffusion models, which can synthesize diverse and realistic images for different domains based on text prompts.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenges of training 3D generative models for diverse domains, such as the need for massive data and camera information, the loss of sample diversity, and the poor text-image correspondence and image quality.
- **How**: The paper leverages a text-to-image diffusion model that can generate diverse images per text prompt by sampling from a latent space conditioned on both text and image. The paper fine-tunes a pre-trained 3D generative model on the source domain using the images generated by the diffusion model on the target domain, without requiring additional data or camera information. The paper also demonstrates various 3D image manipulations using text, such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It proposes **DATID-3D**, a domain adaptation method tailored for 3D generative models using text-to-image diffusion models that can synthesize diverse images per text prompt without collecting additional images and camera information for the target domain.
- It fine-tunes the state-of-the-art 3D generator of the source domain to synthesize high resolution, multi-view consistent images in text-guided targeted domains without additional data, outperforming the existing text-guided domain adaptation methods in diversity and text-image correspondence.
- It proposes and demonstrates diverse 3D image manipulations such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction to fully enjoy diversity in text.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper introduces **DATID-3D**, which consists of two main components: a **text-to-image diffusion model** and a **3D generative model**.
- The text-to-image diffusion model is based on the **Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs)** framework, which models the image generation process as a reverse diffusion process from a Gaussian noise to a natural image. The paper modifies the DPMs to condition on both text and image, and uses the **CLIP** model as a text encoder and a perceptual loss function.
- The 3D generative model is based on the **NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)** framework, which represents a scene as a continuous 5D function that maps 3D coordinates and viewing directions to colors and densities. The paper uses the **PlenOctrees** model as the 3D generator, which combines NeRF with an octree structure for efficient rendering and storage.
- The paper fine-tunes the pre-trained 3D generator on the source domain using the images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model on the target domain. The paper uses a **self-supervised loss** that measures the reconstruction error between the generated images and the rendered images from the 3D generator, as well as a **perceptual loss** that measures the feature similarity between them using CLIP.
- The paper also proposes various 3D image manipulations using text, such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction. The paper uses a **masking technique** to select a specific region or instance in the image to apply text-guided changes, and a **view synthesis technique** to reconstruct the 3D scene from a single view with text-guided modifications.
