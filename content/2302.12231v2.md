Here is a summary of the paper:

**What**: The paper proposes a method to regularize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) with a learned prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM).

**Why**: NeRFs are a powerful technique for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but they suffer from artifacts and implausible geometries when trained with few or noisy input views. Existing regularizers and priors are either hand-crafted or not expressive enough to capture the complexity of natural scenes.

**How**: The paper trains a DDM on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and uses it to predict the gradient of the log-likelihood of color and depth patches. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered from the scene and the DDM gradient is used to update the color and density fields. The paper evaluates the method on LLFF and DTU datasets and shows improved quality and generalization compared to other NeRF methods.

The summary is based on the abstract[^1^][1] and introduction[^1^][1] of the paper.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

The paper presents a method to regularize NeRFs with a learned prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). The method consists of two main components: a DDM that is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset, and a NeRF that is trained with the DDM gradient as an additional regularization term.

The DDM is a generative model that learns to sample realistic RGBD patches from a simple Gaussian distribution, by applying a sequence of noisy and denoising transitions. The DDM can also predict the gradient of the log-likelihood of a given RGBD patch, which measures how likely it is under the learned distribution.

The NeRF is a neural network that maps 3D points and viewing directions to color and density values, following the original NeRF formulation . The NeRF is trained with a photometric reconstruction loss that minimizes the difference between rendered and observed images, as well as a DDM regularization loss that maximizes the log-likelihood of rendered RGBD patches. The DDM regularization loss is computed by rendering random RGBD patches from the scene and using the DDM gradient to update the color and density fields.

The paper also introduces some modifications to the NeRF architecture and training procedure, such as using positional encoding for depth values, adding skip connections between layers, using AdamW optimizer with cosine annealing schedule, and using progressive rendering to speed up training.

The summary is based on sections 3[^1^][1] and 4[^1^][1] of the paper.
