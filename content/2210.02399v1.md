Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents Phenaki, a model that can generate realistic videos from open domain textual descriptions that vary in length and content.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenges of video generation from text, such as computational cost, data scarcity, and variable length of videos.
- **How**: The paper introduces a new model that consists of three components: a video tokenizer that compresses the video into discrete tokens using causal attention, a bidirectional masked transformer that generates video tokens from text tokens, and a video de-tokenizer that reconstructs the video from the video tokens. The paper also shows how joint training on image-text and video-text data can improve the generalization ability of the model.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A new model for video generation from open domain text that can handle variable length videos and prompts.
- A new video tokenizer and de-tokenizer that use causal attention and discrete tokens to compress and reconstruct videos efficiently and consistently.
- A new bidirectional masked transformer that can generate video tokens from text tokens in a conditional and autoregressive manner.
- A new joint training strategy that leverages image-text and video-text data to improve the model's generalization and diversity.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a model that consists of three components: a video tokenizer, a bidirectional masked transformer, and a video de-tokenizer.
- The video tokenizer takes a video sequence as input and outputs a sequence of discrete tokens that represent the video content. The tokenizer uses a 3D convolutional network to extract features from the video frames, and then applies a causal self-attention layer to capture the temporal dependencies. The features are then quantized into discrete tokens using a vector quantization module. The tokenizer also outputs a codebook that maps each token to a vector representation.
- The bidirectional masked transformer takes a sequence of text tokens as input and outputs a sequence of video tokens that match the text description. The transformer uses a bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture that is conditioned on the text tokens. The encoder uses a standard transformer encoder to encode the text tokens, and the decoder uses a masked transformer decoder to generate the video tokens. The decoder masks out some of the video tokens during training and inference, and predicts them based on the text tokens and the unmasked video tokens. The transformer also uses an attention mechanism to attend to the text tokens and the codebook.
- The video de-tokenizer takes a sequence of video tokens as input and outputs a video sequence that corresponds to the video tokens. The de-tokenizer uses a 3D convolutional network to decode the vector representations of the video tokens into video frames, and then applies a pixel shuffle layer to upsample the frames to the desired resolution. The de-tokenizer also uses a skip connection to add the residual information from the tokenizer to the decoder output.
- The paper also describes how the model is trained on two datasets: Conceptual Captions, which contains image-text pairs, and YouCook2, which contains video-text pairs. The paper shows how joint training on both datasets can improve the model's performance and diversity. The paper also introduces two evaluation metrics: Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Text-Video Alignment Score (TVAS), which measure the quality and relevance of the generated videos respectively.
