Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes InstantBooth, a novel approach for personalized text-to-image generation without test-time finetuning.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing personalization approaches that require heavy test-time finetuning for each concept, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale.
- **How**: The paper achieves this by learning the general concept of the input images with a learnable image encoder, and learning rich visual feature representation with a few adapter layers to the pre-trained text-to-image model. The paper shows that InstantBooth can generate competitive results on unseen concepts concerning language-image alignment, image fidelity, and identity preservation while being 100 times faster than test-time finetuning-based methods.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It proposes **InstantBooth**, a novel approach for personalized text-to-image generation without test-time finetuning, which is faster and more scalable than existing methods.
- It introduces a **learnable image encoder** that converts a set of input images to a textual token representing the general concept of the images.
- It adds a few **adapter layers** to the pre-trained text-to-image model that learn rich visual feature representation for identity preservation.
- It trains the model only on **text-image pairs** without using paired images of the same concept, which reduces the data requirement and simplifies the training process.
- It evaluates the model on various unseen concepts and shows that it can generate **competitive results** concerning language-image alignment, image fidelity, and identity preservation.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][2]:

- The paper builds upon a pre-trained text-to-image model called DALL-E , which consists of a discrete variational autoencoder (VAE) and a transformer decoder.
- The paper introduces two main components to enable instant personalization: an image encoder and adapter layers.
- The image encoder takes a set of input images of the same concept and encodes them into a textual token that represents the general concept. The token is then concatenated with the input prompt and fed into the transformer decoder.
- The adapter layers are inserted between the transformer decoder blocks and learn rich visual feature representation for identity preservation. The adapter layers are lightweight and have fewer parameters than the original decoder blocks.
- The paper trains the image encoder and adapter layers on text-image pairs from Conceptual Captions  without using paired images of the same concept. The paper uses contrastive learning to align the image encoder output with the VAE output, and uses cross-entropy loss to optimize the adapter layers.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Load the pre-trained text-to-image model DALL-E
dalle = load_model("DALL-E")

# Define the image encoder and adapter layers
image_encoder = ImageEncoder()
adapter_layers = AdapterLayers()

# Train the image encoder and adapter layers on text-image pairs
for text, image in text_image_pairs:
  # Encode the image to a textual token
  token = image_encoder(image)
  # Concatenate the token and text as input
  input = token + text
  # Generate the output image with DALL-E
  output = dalle(input)
  # Compute the contrastive loss between token and VAE output
  contrastive_loss = contrastive(token, dalle.vae_output)
  # Compute the cross-entropy loss between output and target image
  cross_entropy_loss = cross_entropy(output, image)
  # Update the parameters of image encoder and adapter layers
  update_params(contrastive_loss + cross_entropy_loss)

# Test the model on unseen concepts
for concept_images, prompt in test_data:
  # Encode the concept images to a textual token
  token = image_encoder(concept_images)
  # Concatenate the token and prompt as input
  input = token + prompt
  # Generate the personalized image with DALL-E and adapter layers
  output = dalle(input, adapter_layers)
  # Display the output image
  display(output)
