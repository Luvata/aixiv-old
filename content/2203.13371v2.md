Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a fine-tuning strategy to refine large-scale pretrained image-text models for zero-shot video understanding tasks, such as action recognition and text-to-video retrieval. The proposed method is called FitCLIP[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper argues that large-scale pretrained image-text models have not been adapted to video, mainly because they do not account for the time dimension and because video frames are different from typical images. The paper also claims that fine-tuning these models on target video datasets can improve performance but also degrade zero-shot capabilities.
- **How**: The paper proposes to fine-tune the image-text model on a large-scale video dataset with natural language captions, such as HowTo100M [^2^][2], using a contrastive loss that encourages the model to align the video and text embeddings. The paper also introduces a temporal sampling strategy that selects representative frames from each video based on their similarity to the caption. The paper evaluates FitCLIP on two zero-shot action recognition tasks and three zero-shot text-to-video retrieval tasks, and shows that it outperforms the original CLIP model and other baselines.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- A fine-tuning strategy to refine large-scale pretrained image-text models for zero-shot video understanding tasks, called FitCLIP.
- A temporal sampling strategy that selects representative frames from each video based on their similarity to the caption, which improves the model's ability to handle the time dimension of videos.
- An extensive evaluation of FitCLIP on five zero-shot video understanding tasks, showing that it outperforms the original CLIP model and other baselines.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes to fine-tune a large-scale pretrained image-text model, such as CLIP [^2^][3], on a large-scale video dataset with natural language captions, such as HowTo100M [^3^][2].
- The paper uses a contrastive loss that encourages the model to align the video and text embeddings in a shared latent space. The loss is computed between pairs of videos and captions sampled from the same video clip or from different clips.
- The paper introduces a temporal sampling strategy that selects representative frames from each video based on their similarity to the caption. The paper uses a cosine similarity metric to compare the frame-level features extracted by the image encoder and the caption embedding produced by the text encoder. The paper selects the top-k most similar frames for each caption, where k is a hyperparameter.
- The paper evaluates the proposed method on five zero-shot video understanding tasks: two action recognition tasks (UCF101  and HMDB51 ) and three text-to-video retrieval tasks (MSR-VTT , ActivityNet Captions  and YouCook2 ). The paper compares FitCLIP with the original CLIP model and other baselines, such as CBT , MIL-NCE  and HERO . The paper reports the results in terms of accuracy for action recognition and recall@k for text-to-video retrieval.
