Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents OPT-IML, a large-scale instruction meta-learning framework for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (LLMs) on a collection of 2000 natural language processing (NLP) tasks described via instructions.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the zero- and few-shot generalization of LLMs to unseen tasks and to characterize the effect of different instruction-tuning decisions on downstream task performance when scaling both model and benchmark sizes.
- **How**: The paper creates OPT-IML Bench, a large benchmark for instruction meta-learning of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated into task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, and prepares an evaluation framework to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully held-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out instances from seen tasks. The paper then fine-tunes OPT models of 30B and 175B parameters on OPT-IML Bench using different objectives, task sampling strategies, demonstrations, and specialized datasets. The paper evaluates the fine-tuned models on four different evaluation benchmarks with diverse tasks and input formats: PromptSource, FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG. The paper also compares the fine-tuned models with existing models fine-tuned on each specific benchmark. [^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][3]

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the **construction of OPT-IML Bench**, a large benchmark for instruction meta-learning of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated into task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, covering a wide range of NLP domains and skills. The paper explains how the tasks are selected, categorized, and formatted using instructions and demonstrations. The paper also provides statistics and examples of the tasks in OPT-IML Bench.
- The paper introduces the **evaluation framework** to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully held-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out instances from seen tasks. The paper defines these generalization types and explains how they are measured using four different evaluation benchmarks with diverse tasks and input formats: PromptSource, FLAN, Super-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG. The paper also provides statistics and examples of the evaluation benchmarks.
- The paper presents the **instruction-tuning decisions** that affect downstream task performance when scaling both model and benchmark sizes, such as the objectives used for fine-tuning, the distribution and diversity of the fine-tuning tasks, the inclusion of specialized datasets related to reasoning and dialogue, fine-tuning with demonstrations, and different task sampling strategies. The paper explains the rationale and implementation details of each decision and reports their empirical results on OPT-30B using the evaluation framework.
- The paper describes the **fine-tuning of OPT-IML 30B and 175B**, which are instruction-tuned versions of OPT, using the insights gained from the instruction-tuning decisions. The paper explains how OPT-IML is fine-tuned on OPT-IML Bench using a combination of objectives, task sampling strategies, demonstrations, and specialized datasets. The paper also reports the performance of OPT-IML at both scales on the evaluation benchmarks using the evaluation framework.
- The paper compares OPT-IML with **existing models fine-tuned on each specific benchmark** and shows that OPT-IML is highly competitive with them. The paper explains how existing models are fine-tuned on each benchmark using their original input formats and reports their performance on the evaluation benchmarks using the evaluation framework.
