Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper proposes a novel method of prompt tuning for multi-label image recognition, called **text-as-image (TaI) prompting**, which treats text descriptions as images and learns text prompts from them.
- Why: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing prompt tuning methods that require visual data (e.g., images) for learning prompts, which may be scarce or expensive to obtain for some tasks or categories. The paper argues that text descriptions are easy to collect and their class labels can be directly derived from the texts themselves.
- How: The paper leverages the image-text contrastive learning framework of CLIP , which aligns the embeddings of images and texts into a shared space. The paper uses sentences in the wild that contain target categories as text descriptions, and learns text prompts by optimizing a supervised loss between the text features and the class labels. The paper also introduces a double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) method, which extracts both coarse-grained and fine-grained embeddings for enhancing the multi-label recognition performance. The paper evaluates the proposed methods on several benchmarks, such as MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, and shows that they outperform zero-shot CLIP and can be combined with existing methods of prompting from images to further improve recognition performance.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper introduces **text-as-image (TaI) prompting**, a novel method of prompt tuning that treats text descriptions as images and learns text prompts from them, without requiring visual data for learning prompts.
- The paper applies TaI prompting to **multi-label image recognition**, a challenging task that requires recognizing multiple categories in an image, and shows that TaI prompting can effectively learn text prompts from sentences in the wild that contain target categories.
- The paper proposes **double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT)**, a method that extracts both coarse-grained and fine-grained embeddings from TaI prompting, and demonstrates that TaI-DPT can enhance the multi-label recognition performance by capturing different levels of semantic information.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments on several benchmarks, such as MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, and shows that the proposed methods outperform zero-shot CLIP and can be combined with existing methods of prompting from images to further improve recognition performance. The paper also provides ablation studies and qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of TaI prompting and TaI-DPT.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the **preliminaries** of CLIP and prompt tuning, and defines the problem of multi-label image recognition. The paper also introduces some notations and symbols used in the paper.
- The paper then presents the proposed **text-as-image (TaI) prompting** method, which treats text descriptions as images and learns text prompts from them. The paper explains how to collect text descriptions from sentences in the wild that contain target categories, how to filter out irrelevant nouns from the text descriptions, how to encode the text descriptions and the class labels using CLIP's text encoder, and how to optimize a supervised loss between the text features and the class embeddings to learn text prompts.
- The paper also proposes **double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT)**, a method that extracts both coarse-grained and fine-grained embeddings from TaI prompting. The paper describes how to use different types of brackets to generate coarse-grained and fine-grained prompts, how to concatenate the two types of embeddings for each class, and how to use a multi-label classifier to predict the class probabilities for a given image.
- The paper finally provides some **implementation details** of the proposed methods, such as the data sources, the hyperparameters, the evaluation metrics, and the baselines. The paper also discusses some potential extensions and limitations of TaI prompting and TaI-DPT.
