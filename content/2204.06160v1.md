Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for controllable person image synthesis, which can generate realistic images of humans with different poses and appearances based on reference images.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately deforming the reference images according to the modifications, which is difficult for conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that lack efficient spatial transformation ability.
- **How**: The paper introduces a neural texture extraction and distribution operation based on double attention, which can extract semantic neural textures from reference feature maps and distribute them according to the target poses. The paper also shows how to fuse neural textures from different references to control the appearance of specific regions. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several datasets and demonstrates its superiority over existing methods.

- **A disentangled and expressive neural texture representation** that can capture the appearance of different semantic entities of person images, such as hair, face, clothes, etc., and allow explicit appearance control by fusing neural textures from different references.
- **Extensive experiments and comparisons** on several datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing methods in terms of visual quality, pose transferability, appearance controllability, and user preference.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper presents a **neural texture extraction and distribution network (NTEDN)** that consists of three modules: a **pose encoder**, a **reference encoder**, and a **texture generator**.
- The pose encoder takes the target pose as input and outputs a pose feature map that encodes the spatial distribution of each body part.
- The reference encoder takes the reference image as input and outputs a reference feature map that encodes the appearance information of the reference person.
- The texture generator takes the pose feature map and the reference feature map as inputs and outputs the target image by applying a **neural texture extraction and distribution (NTED) operation** based on double attention.
- The NTED operation first extracts semantic neural textures from the reference feature map by applying a **texture extraction attention (TEA)** module, which computes an attention weight for each semantic entity (such as hair, face, clothes, etc.) based on the pose feature map.
- The NTED operation then distributes the extracted neural textures to the target image by applying a **texture distribution attention (TDA)** module, which computes an attention weight for each pixel in the target image based on the pose feature map and the extracted neural textures.
- The paper also introduces a **neural texture fusion (NTF) operation** that can fuse neural textures from different references to control the appearance of specific regions in the target image. The NTF operation computes a fusion weight for each semantic entity based on the similarity between the reference feature maps and the target pose feature map.
