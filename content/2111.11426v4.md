Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper is a comprehensive review of neural fields, a class of coordinate-based neural networks that parametrize physical properties of scenes or objects across space and time.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide context, mathematical grounding, and an extensive literature survey on neural fields, which have seen successful application in various visual computing problems such as 3D shape and image synthesis, human body animation, 3D reconstruction, and pose estimation.
- **How**: The paper covers research along two dimensions. In Part I, it focuses on techniques in neural fields by identifying common components of neural field methods, including different representations, architectures, forward mapping, and generalization methods. In Part II, it focuses on applications of neural fields to different problems in visual computing and beyond (e.g., robotics, audio). The paper also presents a companion website that contributes a living version of this review that can be continually updated by the community.


## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It provides a unified formulation and terminology for neural fields, which can help researchers and practitioners to better understand and compare different methods.
- It reviews the state-of-the-art techniques in neural fields, highlighting their advantages and limitations, and discussing open challenges and future directions.
- It surveys the diverse applications of neural fields in visual computing and beyond, demonstrating their improved quality, flexibility, and capability over traditional methods.
- It creates a companion website that serves as a living resource for the community, where new papers, code, data, and media related to neural fields can be added and updated.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- **Neural Field Representation**: This subsection defines the neural field as a function that maps a coordinate vector to a feature vector, and discusses different choices of coordinate spaces and feature spaces for different applications.
- **Neural Field Architecture**: This subsection describes the neural network architectures that can be used to implement the neural field function, and compares different design choices such as implicit vs. explicit networks, continuous vs. discrete networks, and feedforward vs. recurrent networks.
- **Neural Field Forward Mapping**: This subsection explains how to render the output from the neural field function, such as images, shapes, or sounds, and introduces different techniques such as ray marching, rasterization, and neural rendering.
- **Neural Field Generalization**: This subsection explores how to improve the generalization ability of neural fields, such as handling unseen viewpoints, poses, shapes, or scenes, and presents different methods such as conditioning, latent codes, meta-learning, and self-supervision.
