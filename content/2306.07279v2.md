Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces Cap3D, an automatic approach for generating descriptive text for 3D objects using pretrained models from image captioning, image-text alignment, and large language models (LLMs).
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenges of 3D asset creation and the scarcity of high-quality captions for 3D objects, which are important for text-conditioned 3D synthesis applications.
- **How**: The paper leverages pretrained models such as BLIP2, CLIP, and GPT4 to consolidate captions from multiple views of a 3D asset, without requiring manual annotation. The paper applies Cap3D to the Objaverse dataset, resulting in 660k 3D-text pairs. The paper evaluates Cap3D using human annotations from the same dataset and the ABO dataset, and shows that Cap3D surpasses human-authored descriptions in terms of quality, cost, and speed. The paper also finetunes text-to-3D models on Cap3D and human captions, and benchmarks the state-of-the-art models such as Point-E, Shape-E, and DreamFusion.


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- The first automatic approach for generating descriptive text for 3D objects using pretrained models, without requiring manual annotation.
- The largest public 3D-text dataset, with 660k pairs of 3D objects and captions, generated by applying Cap3D to the Objaverse dataset.
- A comprehensive evaluation of Cap3D using human annotations from the Objaverse and ABO datasets, showing that Cap3D outperforms human-authored descriptions in terms of quality, cost, and speed.
- A demonstration of the effectiveness of Cap3D for text-to-3D synthesis, by finetuning text-to-3D models on Cap3D and human captions, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art models.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes Cap3D, a three-step approach for generating descriptive text for 3D objects using pretrained models.
- The first step is to use BLIP2, a pretrained image captioning model, to generate captions for eight views of a 3D object. BLIP2 is based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large-scale image-text dataset.
- The second step is to use CLIP, a pretrained image-text alignment model, to select the most relevant captions from the eight views. CLIP is based on the contrastive learning framework and trained on a large-scale image-text dataset.
- The third step is to use GPT4, a pretrained LLM, to consolidate the selected captions into a single coherent description. GPT4 is based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large-scale text corpus.
- The paper also describes how to engineer effective prompts for GPT4 to generate different types of descriptions, such as geometric, functional, or aesthetic.

  captions = []
  # For each view of the object
  for view in object.get_views(num_views):
    # Generate a caption using BLIP2
