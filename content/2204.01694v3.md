Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper introduces a new learning setup called **Personalized Vision & Language (PerVL)** and two new benchmark datasets for retrieving and segmenting user-specific visual concepts in unstructured language[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of how to extend large vision & language models pretrained on web-scale data to reason about personalized concepts that are not part of their vocabulary or training data[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper proposes an architecture that expands the input vocabulary of a pretrained model with new word embeddings for the personalized concepts, and trains them on a few image examples provided by the user. The model can then use the personalized concepts as part of a sentence to perform various downstream tasks such as image retrieval and semantic segmentation[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The paper demonstrates that their approach outperforms the strongest baseline by 51.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for image retrieval[^2^][2].

According to the paper[^1^][1], this paper makes the following novel contributions:

- A new representation learning setup, **PerVL**, for personalizing V&L representations, while keeping their "zero-shot" reasoning capabilities.
- Two new benchmark datasets for PerVL: **PerVL-Image-Retrieval** and **PerVL-Semantic-Segmentation**.
- A novel approach, **PALAVRA**, to expand and personalize the vocabulary of the V&L representation inputs.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a method called **PALAVRA** that personalizes the input vocabulary of a pretrained V&L model by adding new word embeddings for the personalized concepts[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- The method consists of three steps: (1) vocabulary expansion, (2) personalized concept learning, and (3) downstream task inference[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- In vocabulary expansion, the method creates new word embeddings for the personalized concepts by concatenating a random vector with a special token embedding that indicates personalization[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- In personalized concept learning, the method trains the new word embeddings on a few image examples provided by the user, using a contrastive loss that encourages the model to align the personalized concepts with their corresponding images and distinguish them from other images[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- In downstream task inference, the method uses the pretrained V&L model with the expanded vocabulary to perform various tasks such as image retrieval and semantic segmentation, using rich textual queries that include the personalized concepts[^1^][1] [^2^][2].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define a pretrained V&L model and a special token for personalization
model = PretrainedVandLModel()
special_token = "<PERS>"

# Define a function to create new word embeddings for personalized concepts
def create_new_word_embeddings(concepts):
  # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the new word embeddings
  new_word_embeddings = {}
  # For each concept, generate a random vector and concatenate it with the special token embedding
  for concept in concepts:
    random_vector = np.random.randn(model.hidden_size // 2)
    special_token_embedding = model.get_word_embedding(special_token)
    new_word_embedding = np.concatenate([random_vector, special_token_embedding])
    # Add the new word embedding to the dictionary with the concept as the key
    new_word_embeddings[concept] = new_word_embedding
  # Return the dictionary of new word embeddings
  return new_word_embeddings

# Define a function to train the new word embeddings on image examples

  # For each epoch, iterate over the image examples
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for image, concept in image_examples:
      # Get the image and text features from the model
      image_features = model.get_image_features(image)
      text_features = model.get_text_features(concept)
      # Compute the contrastive loss between the image and text features

      # Update the new word embeddings using the optimizer
      optimizer.zero_grad()
      loss.backward()

def perform_downstream_task(model, new_word_embeddings, task, query, data):
  # Expand the model's input vocabulary with the new word embeddings
  model.expand_input_vocabulary(new_word_embeddings)
  # Depending on the task, use the model to perform inference with the query and data
