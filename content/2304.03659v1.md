Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a novel framework for probing and improving relational, compositional and contextual understanding of large visual-language models (V+L).
- **Why**: The paper aims to assess and improve the conceptual understanding capabilities of large V+L models, which are important for real-world applications but not well understood.
- **How**: The paper proposes a novel benchmarking dataset for probing three aspects of content understanding: relational (how objects and predicates relate to each other), compositional (how objects and subjects can be combined or swapped), and contextual (how background information affects object recognition). The paper also experiments with five well-known V+L models, such as CLIP and ViLT, and finds that they mostly fail to demonstrate a conceptual understanding. The paper then proposes a new finetuning technique that rewards the three conceptual understanding measures.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- **A novel benchmarking dataset** for probing relational, compositional and contextual understanding of large V+L models, based on cognitive science principles and image-text matching tasks.
- **A comprehensive evaluation** of five state-of-the-art V+L models on the proposed dataset, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in conceptual understanding.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the **construction** of the benchmarking dataset, which consists of three sub-datasets: Probe-R, Probe-C, and Probe-X. Each sub-dataset contains image-text matching tasks that test a specific aspect of conceptual understanding: relational, compositional, or contextual. The paper explains how the tasks are designed, how the images and texts are collected and annotated, and how the difficulty and diversity of the tasks are ensured.
- The paper describes the **evaluation** of five state-of-the-art V+L models on the benchmarking dataset: CLIP [37], ViLT [26], UNITER [1], OSCAR [39], and VILLA [42]. The paper reports the accuracy and recall scores of each model on each sub-dataset, as well as the overall score. The paper also analyzes the performance of each model in terms of different attributes, such as object categories, predicates, compositions, and backgrounds.
- The paper describes the **improvement** of the conceptual understanding of large V+L models using a new finetuning technique. The paper proposes to use a weighted loss function that incorporates the three conceptual understanding measures as additional objectives. The paper also introduces a new data augmentation strategy that generates hard negative examples by swapping objects or backgrounds in image-text pairs. The paper shows that the finetuned models achieve better performance on downstream tasks, such as image retrieval and visual question answering.
