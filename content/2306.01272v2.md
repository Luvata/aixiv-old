Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper presents a novel method to account for the effect of a hot, dense plasma on nuclear fusion reactions, using the theory of open quantum systems.
- Why: The paper aims to understand the cosmic origins of heavy elements and the stellar evolution, which depend on nuclear fusion reactions that often occur in high-energy density plasmas (HEDPs).
- How: The paper uses a model of (3+1)-dimensional leptogenesis that requires a CPT-violating background of the Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion field. The KR axion is a pseudoscalar field that is dual to the field strength of the spin-one field present in the massless gravitational multiplet in the theory of closed bosonic strings. The paper derives an axion potential by integrating out at one loop a single sterile right-handed neutrino (RHN) with mass mN. The paper shows that the stability of this potential is important for the viability of the model and depends on the ratio of the torsion-induced-axion coupling to mN. The paper also discusses possible experimental tests of the model using targets prepared in excited states.

The paper at [^1^][1] claims the following contributions:

- It conducts pioneering studies of thermal and atomic effects on fusion probability at a broad range of temperatures and densities, using the theory of open quantum systems.
- It uses a 188Os nucleus as a target that interacts with an inert 16O projectile, and shows that thermal effects yield an average increase in fusion probability of 15.5% and 36.9% for the test nuclei at temperatures of 0.1 and 0.5 MeV respectively, compared to calculations at zero temperature.
- It suggests that thermal effects could be tested in a laboratory using targets prepared in excited states as envisaged in facilities exploiting laser-nucleus interactions.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper uses the theory of open quantum systems to model the nuclear fusion reaction as a system coupled to a thermal bath (the plasma).
- The paper adopts the Lindblad master equation to describe the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system, and incorporates the thermal and atomic effects through appropriate Lindblad operators.
- The paper employs the coupled-channels method to solve the Schrödinger equation for the relative motion of the projectile and target nuclei, and calculates the fusion probability as a function of the incident energy.
- The paper chooses a 188Os nucleus as a target that has low-lying excited states that can be populated at stellar temperatures, and an inert 16O projectile that does not couple to these states.
- The paper performs numerical simulations for different values of temperature and density of the plasma, and compares the results with those obtained at zero temperature.
