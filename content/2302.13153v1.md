Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called **Directed Diffusion** that allows direct control of object placement in text-guided image generation using diffusion models[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing text-guided diffusion models such as DALLE-2, IMAGEN, and Stable Diffusion, which often struggle to compose scenes containing several key objects in specified positional relationships[^1^][1]. This capability is crucial for storytelling applications such as storybooks[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper takes a straightforward approach by injecting activation at desired positions in the cross-attention maps corresponding to the objects under control, while attenuating the remainder of the map[^1^][1]. This way, the model can generate images that respect the positional constraints given by the text prompt, while maintaining a coherent blend between the positioned objects and the background[^1^][1]. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on various tasks such as positioning a single object, multiple objects, and creating storyboards[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper introduces **Directed Diffusion**, a simple and effective method for direct control of object placement in text-guided image generation using diffusion models.
- The paper shows that Directed Diffusion can provide positional control over multiple objects, while making use of an existing pre-trained model and maintaining a coherent blend between the positioned objects and the background.
- The paper demonstrates the applicability of Directed Diffusion to various tasks such as positioning a single object, multiple objects, and creating storyboards. The paper also provides qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the method.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper builds on the **Stable Diffusion** model[^1^][1], which is a text-guided diffusion model that can generate high-quality images from text prompts using a pre-trained CLIP model[^1^][1].
- The paper introduces a simple modification to the Stable Diffusion model, which is to inject activation at desired positions in the cross-attention maps corresponding to the objects under control, while attenuating the remainder of the map[^1^][1]. This is done by multiplying the cross-attention maps by a mask that has high values at the desired positions and low values elsewhere[^1^][1].
- The paper defines the desired positions as either absolute or relative coordinates in the image space, which can be specified by the user or inferred from the text prompt using a simple heuristic[^1^][1]. The paper also defines the objects under control as either single tokens or token groups that correspond to semantic entities in the text prompt[^1^][1].
- The paper shows how to apply the method to various tasks such as positioning a single object, multiple objects, and creating storyboards[^1^][1]. The paper also provides an ablation study and a comparison with other methods[^1^][1].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt T and a desired position P for each object O in T
# Output: an image I that matches T and P

# Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and the CLIP model
model = load_stable_diffusion_model()
clip = load_clip_model()

# Initialize the image I with random noise
I = random_noise()

# Define the number of diffusion steps N
N = 1000

# Define the mask M for each object O in T
M = {}
for O in T:
  # Create a mask with high values at P and low values elsewhere
  M[O] = create_mask(P[O])

# Perform diffusion for N steps
for t in range(N):
  # Compute the noise level epsilon_t
  epsilon_t = compute_noise_level(t, N)

  # Compute the cross-attention maps A between I and T using CLIP
  A = clip.cross_attention(I, T)

  # Modify the cross-attention maps A by multiplying them with M
  for O in T:
    A[O] = A[O] * M[O]

  # Compute the loss L between I and T using CLIP and A
  L = clip.loss(I, T, A)

  # Update I by minimizing L and adding noise epsilon_t
  I = update_image(I, L, epsilon_t)

# Return the final image I
return I
```
