Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper investigates a phenomenon called **out-of-distribution forgetting (OODF)**, which is a special form of catastrophic forgetting raised by the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in continual learning settings. OODF occurs when introducing an intra-class distribution shift significantly impairs the recognition accuracy of CL methods for that category during subsequent learning.
- Why: The paper aims to identify an under-attended risk during CL, highlighting the importance of developing approaches that can overcome OODF. The paper also compares the effects of OODF in CL and joint learning scenarios, and explores the factors that influence OODF, such as the level and type of distribution shift, the number of tasks, and the CL methods used.
- How: The paper conducts experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) with different types of distribution shifts (rotation, brightness, contrast, and blur). The paper evaluates four representative CL methods (EWC, SI, LwF, and GEM) and compares them with joint learning. The paper also proposes a metric to quantify OODF and analyzes its relationship with other metrics such as accuracy and forgetting.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper uses three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) and splits them into multiple tasks according to different types of distribution shifts (rotation, brightness, contrast, and blur).
- The paper evaluates four representative CL methods (EWC, SI, LwF, and GEM) and compares them with joint learning in terms of accuracy and forgetting on each task.
- The paper proposes a metric to quantify OODF based on the difference between the accuracy of CL methods and joint learning on each category after learning all tasks.
- The paper analyzes the factors that influence OODF, such as the level and type of distribution shift, the number of tasks, and the CL methods used. The paper also discusses the possible causes and implications of OODF.
