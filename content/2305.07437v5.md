Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new framework for continual vision-language representation learning with off-diagonal information, called Mod-X.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting and spatial disorder in CLIP model when trained on streaming data from different domains.
- **How**: The paper analyzes the spatial variations of the contrastive matrices in CLIP model and proposes to selectively align the off-diagonal information distribution of these matrices to maintain the multi-modal representation space alignment. The paper also provides empirical and theoretical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper is the first to explore the feasibility of continual CLIP training using streaming data and reveal the significant performance degeneration of CLIP in the continual setting.
- The paper proposes a novel concept of Spatial Disorder (SD) to characterize the spatial variations of the contrastive matrices in CLIP model and demonstrates how SD leads to a performance decline for CLIP on cross-modal retrieval tasks.
- The paper proposes a new continual vision-language representation learning framework Mod-X that can selectively align the off-diagonal information distribution of contrastive matrices and maintain the multi-modal representation space alignment on the old data domain while fitting the new data domain.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments on commonly used datasets with different scales and scopes and shows that Mod-X can effectively alleviate SD and improve the capability of the multi-modal model in the continual setting.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the CLIP model and its contrastive learning objective, which consists of two contrastive matrices: one for image-text pairs and one for text-text pairs.
- The paper then defines the concept of Spatial Disorder (SD) as the spatial variations of the contrastive matrices caused by continual learning on streaming data. The paper shows that SD can be divided into two types: Intra-modal Rotation and Inter-modal Deviation.
- The paper then proposes a new framework Mod-X that can maintain the off-diagonal information matrix of the contrastive matrices to alleviate SD. The paper explains how Mod-X can selectively align the off-diagonal information distribution of the contrastive matrices by using a regularization term and a projection matrix.
- The paper then provides empirical and theoretical analysis of Mod-X and shows that Mod-X can effectively reduce SD and improve the cross-modal retrieval performance of CLIP in the continual setting.
