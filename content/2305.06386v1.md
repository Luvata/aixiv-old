Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to map text to concept vectors that can be compared directly to image representations obtained from off-the-shelf vision models, and vice versa. The method is based on aligning the representation space of a given vision model to the representation space of a CLIP model, which is trained on image-text pairs. The paper also demonstrates various applications of this method, such as zero-shot classification, concept bottleneck models, distribution shift diagnosis, and image retrieval.
- **Why**: The paper aims to bridge the gap between human language and deep vision models, which often have different architectures and training objectives. By aligning the representation spaces of different models, the paper enables a two-way communication across model representation spaces and to humans through language. The paper also shows that existing deep models have similar representations of input samples, despite their diversity.
- **How**: The paper uses a linear layer to learn the mapping between an image's representation in one model to its representation in another. The paper uses CLIP as a reference model, since it has a shared representation space for images and text. The paper then uses text embeddings from CLIP's text encoder as concept vectors that can be compared to the aligned image features. The paper also uses a GPT-based CLIP decoder to generate text from arbitrary vectors in the representation space. The paper evaluates the method on various tasks and datasets, and compares it with baselines and ablations.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper introduces **text-to-concept**, a method to map text to concept vectors that can be compared directly to image representations obtained from off-the-shelf vision models, and vice versa, by aligning the representation space of a given vision model to the representation space of a CLIP model.
- The paper shows that **text-to-concept** can convert fixed off-the-shelf vision encoders to surprisingly strong zero-shot classifiers for free, with accuracy at times even surpassing that of CLIP, despite being much smaller models and trained on a small fraction of the data compared to CLIP.
- The paper demonstrates other immediate use-cases of **text-to-concept**, such as building concept bottleneck models with no concept supervision, diagnosing distribution shifts in terms of human concepts, and retrieving images satisfying a set of text-based constraints.
- The paper also demonstrates the feasibility of **concept-to-text**, where vectors in a model's feature space are decoded by first aligning to the CLIP before being fed to a GPT-based generative model.
- The paper suggests that existing deep models, with presumably diverse architectures and training, represent input samples relatively similarly, and a two-way communication across model representation spaces and to humans (through language) is viable.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the details of **text-to-concept**, which consists of two steps: 1) aligning the representation space of a given vision model to the representation space of a CLIP model using a linear layer, and 2) comparing the aligned image features to the text embeddings from CLIP's text encoder using cosine similarity. The paper also explains how to obtain concept vectors from text using CLIP's text encoder, and how to use them for various tasks such as zero-shot classification, concept bottleneck models, distribution shift diagnosis, and image retrieval.
- The paper also describes the details of **concept-to-text**, which consists of two steps: 1) aligning the representation space of a given vision model to the representation space of a CLIP model using a linear layer, and 2) decoding the aligned image features using a GPT-based CLIP decoder that is trained on image-text pairs. The paper also explains how to generate text from arbitrary vectors in the representation space, and how to use them for tasks such as captioning, summarization, and storytelling.
