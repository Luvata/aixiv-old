Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new task called **Text synopsis to Video Storyboard (TeViS)** which aims to retrieve an ordered sequence of images to visualize the text synopsis[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper argues that creating video storyboards is a challenging and useful task for video creation which not only requires association between high-level texts and images, but also demands for long-term reasoning to make transitions smooth across shots[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper constructs a **MovieNet-TeViS benchmark** based on the public MovieNet dataset. It contains 10K text synopses each paired with keyframes that are manually selected from corresponding movies by considering both relevance and cinematic coherence[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The paper also presents an **encoder-decoder baseline** for the task. The model uses a pretrained vision-and-language model to improve high-level text-image matching. To improve coherence in long-term shots, the paper further proposes to pre-train the decoder on large-scale movie frames without text[^1^][1].

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- They propose a new task called **Text synopsis to Video Storyboard (TeViS)** which aims to retrieve an ordered sequence of images to visualize the text synopsis.
- They construct a **MovieNet-TeViS benchmark** based on the public MovieNet dataset. It contains 10K text synopses each paired with keyframes that are manually selected from corresponding movies by considering both relevance and cinematic coherence.
- They present an **encoder-decoder baseline** for the task. The model uses a pretrained vision-and-language model to improve high-level text-image matching. To improve coherence in long-term shots, they further propose to pre-train the decoder on large-scale movie frames without text.
- They conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate their model and compare it with other models. They also provide qualitative examples and human evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their model.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section:

- The paper formulates the **Text synopsis to Video Storyboard (TeViS)** task as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Given a text synopsis, the model aims to retrieve an ordered sequence of images from a large-scale image pool to visualize the text.
- The paper adopts an **encoder-decoder framework** for the task. The encoder consists of a pretrained vision-and-language model that encodes both the text synopsis and the candidate images into a common feature space. The decoder consists of a recurrent neural network that generates an image sequence by attending to the encoded features.
- The paper proposes to pre-train the decoder on large-scale movie frames without text to improve its ability to generate coherent and diverse shots. The paper also introduces two losses to train the model: a cross-entropy loss that measures the relevance between the generated and ground-truth images, and a triplet loss that encourages the model to retrieve images that are more similar to the text than other images.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the encoder-decoder model
model = EncoderDecoder()

# Pre-train the decoder on large-scale movie frames without text
for frame_sequence in movie_frames:
  # Generate a frame sequence using the decoder
  generated_sequence = model.decoder.generate(frame_sequence[:-1])
  # Compute the cross-entropy loss between the generated and ground-truth frames
  loss = cross_entropy_loss(generated_sequence, frame_sequence[1:])
  # Update the decoder parameters using back-propagation
  model.decoder.update(loss)

# Fine-tune the model on text synopses and keyframes
for text_synopsis, keyframe_sequence in MovieNet-TeViS:
  # Encode the text synopsis and the candidate images using the encoder
  text_feature, image_features = model.encoder.encode(text_synopsis, image_pool)
  # Generate an image sequence using the decoder
  generated_sequence = model.decoder.generate(text_feature, image_features)
  # Compute the cross-entropy loss between the generated and ground-truth images
  loss1 = cross_entropy_loss(generated_sequence, keyframe_sequence)
  # Compute the triplet loss between the text feature and the image features
  loss2 = triplet_loss(text_feature, image_features, keyframe_sequence)
  # Update the model parameters using back-propagation
  model.update(loss1 + loss2)

# Test the model on new text synopses
for text_synopsis in test_set:
  # Encode the text synopsis and the candidate images using the encoder
  text_feature, image_features = model.encoder.encode(text_synopsis, image_pool)
  # Generate an image sequence using the decoder
  generated_sequence = model.decoder.generate(text_feature, image_features)
  # Output the generated sequence as the video storyboard
  output(generated_sequence)
```
