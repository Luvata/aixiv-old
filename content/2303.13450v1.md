Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel framework for synthesizing and manipulating 3D scenes from text using object proxies and neural radiance fields (NeRFs).
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text-guided image generation methods that cannot control the placement or appearance of individual objects in the scene, as they represent the scene as a whole.
- **How**: The paper introduces a Global-Local training scheme that alternates between optimizing each object's NeRF independently and as part of the full scene. This allows learning a complete representation of each object, while also creating a harmonious scene with style and lighting match. The paper also shows how to use proxies to enable various editing options, such as adjusting, removing, or refining objects in the scene.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It presents the first method for text-guided 3D scene synthesis and manipulation that can control the placement and appearance of individual objects using proxies and NeRFs.
- It proposes a novel Global-Local training framework that alternates between optimizing each object's NeRF on its own and as part of the full scene, achieving a balance between object-level and scene-level coherence.
- It demonstrates a wide range of editing capabilities enabled by proxies, such as adjusting the position, orientation, scale, and shape of objects, removing objects from a scene, or refining an object's appearance or geometry.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section:

- The method takes as input a text description of a scene and a set of proxies that define the placement and optionally the coarse geometry of each object in the scene.
- The method represents each object as an independent NeRF, which is a neural network that maps a 3D location and viewing direction to a color and density value.
- The method trains each object's NeRF using a Global-Local scheme that consists of two stages: a global stage and a local stage.
- In the global stage, the method renders the full scene by querying the NeRFs of all objects and compositing them using alpha blending. The method optimizes the NeRFs to minimize the reconstruction loss between the rendered image and a ground truth image, as well as a style loss that encourages the objects to match the style of the text description.
- In the local stage, the method renders each object separately by querying its NeRF and masking out the background. The method optimizes the NeRF to minimize the reconstruction loss between the rendered image and a ground truth image, as well as a shape loss that encourages the object to match its proxy geometry if available.
- The method alternates between the global and local stages until convergence, resulting in a set of NeRFs that represent each object in the scene. The method can then use the proxies to manipulate the scene in various ways, such as changing the position, orientation, scale, or shape of an object, removing an object from the scene, or refining an object's appearance or geometry.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: text description T and proxies P
# Output: NeRFs N for each object in the scene

# Initialize N randomly
# Repeat until convergence:
  # Global stage:
    # For each image I in the dataset:
      # Render the full scene S by querying N and compositing them
      # Compute the reconstruction loss L_r between S and I
      # Compute the style loss L_s between S and T using a pretrained CLIP model
      # Update N by minimizing L_r + L_s
  # Local stage:
    # For each object O in the scene:
      # Render O separately by querying its NeRF and masking out the background
      # Compute the reconstruction loss L_r between O and its ground truth image
      # If O has a proxy geometry G, compute the shape loss L_g between O and G using Chamfer distance
      # Update O's NeRF by minimizing L_r + L_g
# Return N
```
