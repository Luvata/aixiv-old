Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called Attend-and-Excite, which is a form of Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN), to improve the semantic fidelity of text-to-image diffusion models.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problem of catastrophic neglect, where the model fails to generate one or more of the subjects from the input text prompt, and attribute binding, where the model fails to correctly assign attributes (e.g., colors) to their corresponding subjects.
- **How**: The paper introduces an attention-based formulation of GSN, where it modifies the cross-attention units between the text and image embeddings during inference time to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthen their activations, encouraging the model to generate all subjects described in the text prompt. The paper evaluates its method on a range of text prompts and compares it to alternative approaches.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It introduces the concept of **Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN)**, where it intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time to improve the semantic fidelity of the generated images.
- It proposes an **attention-based formulation of GSN**, called **Attend-and-Excite**, which modifies the cross-attention units between the text and image embeddings to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthen their activations.
- It analyzes the **Stable Diffusion model** and assesses the existence of **catastrophic neglect** and **attribute binding** problems in text-to-image generation.
- It compares its approach to alternative approaches and demonstrates that it conveys the desired concepts more faithfully across a range of text prompts.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper builds on the **Stable Diffusion model**[^1^][1], which is a text-to-image diffusion model that uses a **cross-attention mechanism** between the text and image embeddings to guide the image generation process.
- The paper introduces the concept of **Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN)**, which is a form of intervention in the generative process during inference time to improve the semantic fidelity of the generated images.
- The paper proposes an **attention-based formulation of GSN**, called **Attend-and-Excite**, which modifies the cross-attention units between the text and image embeddings to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthen their activations.
- The paper defines a **subject token** as a token that represents a noun or a noun phrase in the text prompt, and uses a **part-of-speech tagger** to identify them.
- The paper uses a **soft attention mask** to refine the cross-attention units, where the mask assigns higher weights to subject tokens and lower weights to other tokens.
- The paper applies an **excitation function** to the cross-attention units, where the function increases the activation of subject tokens by a factor of alpha and decreases the activation of other tokens by a factor of beta.
- The paper sets alpha and beta as hyperparameters that control the degree of excitation, and tunes them on a validation set.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt T and a noise image X_0
# Output: a generated image X_T that matches the text prompt

# Initialize the Stable Diffusion model with parameters theta
model = StableDiffusion(theta)

# Extract the text embedding E_T from the text prompt T using a transformer encoder
E_T = transformer_encoder(T)

# Identify the subject tokens S in the text prompt T using a part-of-speech tagger
S = pos_tagger(T)

# Create a soft attention mask M that assigns higher weights to subject tokens and lower weights to other tokens
M = create_mask(S)

# Set the excitation factors alpha and beta
alpha = 1.5 # increase the activation of subject tokens by 1.5
beta = 0.5 # decrease the activation of other tokens by 0.5

# Loop over the diffusion steps from t = 0 to t = T
for t in range(0, T):

  # Extract the image embedding E_X_t from the image X_t using a convolutional encoder
  E_X_t = conv_encoder(X_t)

  # Compute the cross-attention units A between the text and image embeddings
  A = cross_attention(E_T, E_X_t)

  # Refine the cross-attention units A using the soft attention mask M
  A = A * M

  # Apply the excitation function to the cross-attention units A using alpha and beta
  A = excite(A, alpha, beta)

  # Generate the next image X_t+1 using the diffusion model and the cross-attention units A
  X_t+1 = model.generate(X_t, A)

# Return the final image X_T
return X_T
```
