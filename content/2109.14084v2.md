Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] [^2^][2]:

- **What**: The paper presents VideoCLIP, a contrastive approach to pre-train a unified model for zero-shot video and text understanding, without using any labels on downstream tasks.
- **Why**: The paper aims to leverage the large-scale unlabeled video and text data available on the web to learn a general representation that can transfer to various video-text tasks without fine-tuning.
- **How**: The paper trains a transformer for video and text by contrasting temporally overlapping positive video-text pairs with hard negatives from nearest neighbor retrieval. The paper also introduces two novelties: (1) using loosely overlapping video-text clips instead of strict timestamp alignment, and (2) using video clusters to form batches with mutually harder videos. The paper evaluates the model on four downstream tasks: text-video retrieval, VideoQA, action localization, and action segmentation. The paper shows that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks, surpassing prior work and even some supervised approaches.

According to the paper[^1^][1] [^2^][2], the main contributions are:

- The paper proposes to pre-train a **unified model** that is capable of zero-shot transfer to **multiple end tasks** for video-text understanding, even surpassing fully-supervised methods in some cases.
- The paper introduces two novel techniques to improve the learning of fine-grained video-text association: (1) using **loosely overlapping video-text clips** instead of enforcing strict timestamp alignment, and (2) using **video clusters** to form batches with mutually harder videos.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1] [^2^][2]:

- The paper describes the **pre-training data**, which is the HowTo100M dataset (Miech et al., 2019) that contains 1.2 million instructional videos and their narrations.
- The paper explains the **model architecture**, which is a transformer-based encoder-decoder model (Vaswani et al., 2017) that takes video and text as inputs and outputs a scalar score for each video-text pair. The model uses a ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) to extract video features and a BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019) to extract text features. The model also uses a cross-modal attention layer to learn the alignment between video and text.
- The paper details the **contrastive objective**, which is to maximize the similarity between positive video-text pairs and minimize the similarity between negative pairs. The paper introduces two novel techniques for sampling positive and negative pairs: (1) using loosely overlapping video-text clips instead of strict timestamp alignment, and (2) using video clusters to form batches with mutually harder videos. The paper also uses temperature scaling and hard negative mining to improve the contrastive learning.
- The paper reports the **pre-training hyperparameters**, such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, etc. The paper also describes how they use distributed training with multiple GPUs to speed up the pre-training process.
- The paper describes the **downstream tasks** that they evaluate their model on, which are text-video retrieval, VideoQA, action localization, and action segmentation. The paper explains how they use zero-shot inference or fine-tuning for each task, and what metrics they use to measure the performance. The paper also compares their model with several baselines and ablations on these tasks.
