Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for learning joint vision-language representations by diversifying the tokenization process, which allows the model to learn tokens that are disentangled from each other and capture features from both modalities.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the performance of vision-language tasks such as visual question answering and video question answering, which require reasoning across images and text. The paper argues that existing methods either do not exploit cross-modality interaction during feature extraction or do not learn diverse tokens that can generalize better.
- **How**: The paper introduces a co-tokenization model that iteratively learns a set of token representations using TokenLearner [23], conditioned on both video and text. The paper also introduces a diversity loss that encourages the tokens to be orthogonal to each other and have different attention patterns. The paper evaluates the proposed method on two datasets: TGIF-QA [15] and TVQA [19], and shows that it outperforms the baseline models and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.[^1^][1]

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- **A novel method for joint vision-language representation learning by diversifying the tokenization learning process**, which enables tokens that are sufficiently disentangled from each other to be learned from both modalities.
- **A diversity loss that encourages the tokens to be orthogonal to each other and have different attention patterns**, which improves the generalization performance of the model.
- **An extensive evaluation of the proposed method on two vision-language datasets: TGIF-QA [15] and TVQA [19]**, which shows that it outperforms the baseline models and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.[^1^][1]

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- **The paper adopts the co-tokenization model [20] as the backbone**, which learns a set of token representations from both video and text using TokenLearner [23], a neural network that maps an input sequence to a fixed number of tokens.
- **The paper introduces a diversity loss that encourages the tokens to be orthogonal to each other and have different attention patterns**, which is added to the cross-entropy loss of the co-tokenization model. The diversity loss consists of two terms: a token orthogonality term and an attention diversity term. The token orthogonality term penalizes the cosine similarity between any pair of tokens, while the attention diversity term penalizes the overlap between any pair of attention maps generated by TokenLearner.
- **The paper evaluates the proposed method on two vision-language datasets: TGIF-QA [15] and TVQA [19]**, which are both video question answering datasets that require reasoning across video and text. The paper compares the proposed method with several baseline models, including Co-tokenization [20], LXMERT [26], ViLBERT [18], and VisualBERT [16]. The paper also conducts ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of the proposed method.[^1^][1]
