Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes a conditional generative model to generate videos from text, using a hybrid framework of VAE and GAN.

Why: The paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of video generation from text, which requires extracting both static and dynamic information from text and producing plausible and diverse videos.

How: The paper uses a conditional VAE model to generate the "gist" of the video from the input text, which is an image that gives the background color and object layout of the video. The content and motion of the video are then generated by conditioning on both the gist and text input, using a GAN model. The paper also develops a method to automatically create a matched text-video corpus from online videos for training the model.

Here is a summary of the method section:

```
The method section consists of four subsections: gist generation, video generation, text-video corpus construction and training details.

- Gist generation: The paper uses a conditional VAE model to generate the gist of the video from the input text, which is an image that gives the background color and object layout of the video. The gist is generated by sampling from a Gaussian distribution whose mean and variance are predicted by an encoder network that takes the text as input. The gist is then decoded by a decoder network that reconstructs the text from the gist.

- Video generation: The paper uses a conditional GAN model to generate the content and motion of the video from both the gist and text input. The generator network takes the gist and text as input and produces a sequence of frames. The discriminator network takes either real or fake frames along with the gist and text as input and tries to distinguish them. The generator network also uses an image filter that is derived from the text input to modulate the appearance and motion of the objects in the video.

- Text-video corpus construction: The paper develops a method to automatically create a matched text-video corpus from publicly available online videos. The method consists of three steps: (1) extracting video clips from YouTube videos based on their captions, (2) filtering out low-quality clips using a pretrained classifier, and (3) matching clips with captions using a pretrained captioning model.

- Training details: The paper trains the VAE and GAN models separately using different loss functions. The VAE model is trained using a reconstruction loss and a KL-divergence loss. The GAN model is trained using an adversarial loss, a content loss, a motion loss and an inception score loss. The paper also provides details on the network architectures, hyperparameters and datasets used for training and evaluation.
