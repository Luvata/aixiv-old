Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper explores diffusion models for text-conditional image synthesis and editing, and compares two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance.

Why: The paper aims to generate high-quality synthetic images that are photorealistic and match the given captions, and to enable powerful text-driven image editing.

How: The paper trains a large-scale text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance, which uses a learned embedding network to project both text and images into a shared latent space. The paper also fine-tunes the model on a filtered dataset for image inpainting, and evaluates the model using human judgments and automatic metrics.

Here are some of the contributions of the paper:

- The paper introduces **classifier-free guidance**, a novel guidance strategy for text-conditional diffusion models that does not require a pretrained classifier or a large vocabulary.
- The paper shows that classifier-free guidance outperforms CLIP guidance in terms of photorealism and caption similarity, according to human evaluations and automatic metrics.
- The paper demonstrates that text-conditional diffusion models can be fine-tuned for image inpainting, and can perform text-driven image editing with high fidelity and flexibility.
- The paper releases the code and weights of a smaller model trained on a filtered dataset, which can generate high-quality images for a variety of captions.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The paper uses diffusion models as the backbone for text-conditional image synthesis and editing. Diffusion models are generative models that learn to reverse a stochastic diffusion process that gradually corrupts an image into pure noise. The paper uses a U-Net architecture with attention layers for the diffusion model, and trains it on a large-scale dataset of images and captions.

The paper compares two different guidance strategies for text-conditional diffusion models: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. CLIP guidance uses a pretrained CLIP model to compute a similarity score between the image and the caption, and uses it as an additional loss term to guide the diffusion process. Classifier-free guidance uses a learned embedding network to project both the image and the caption into a shared latent space, and uses the cosine distance between the embeddings as an additional loss term to guide the diffusion process.

The paper also fine-tunes the text-conditional diffusion model on a filtered dataset for image inpainting, where some regions of the image are masked out and replaced with noise. The paper uses a simple masking strategy that randomly selects a rectangular region to mask out, and appends a text description of the mask location to the caption. The paper shows that the fine-tuned model can perform text-driven image editing by changing the caption or the mask location.
