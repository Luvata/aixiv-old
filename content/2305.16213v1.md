Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes a new framework for text-to-3D generation, called ProlificDreamer, which uses variational score distillation (VSD) to improve the diversity and quality of 3D samples generated from text descriptions.

Why: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing text-to-3D methods, such as score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffer from over-saturation, over-smoothing, and low-diversity problems.

How: The paper models the 3D parameter as a random variable instead of a constant as in SDS, and uses a particle-based variational inference technique to sample from the posterior distribution. The paper also introduces various improvements in the design space for text-to-3D, such as distillation time schedule and density initialization. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several datasets and shows that it can generate high-fidelity and diverse 3D scenes from text.

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- A new framework for text-to-3D generation, called ProlificDreamer, which uses variational score distillation (VSD) to improve the diversity and quality of 3D samples generated from text descriptions.
- A theoretical analysis of the existing score distillation sampling (SDS) method and its limitations, and a derivation of VSD as a principled particle-based variational inference technique.
- Various improvements in the design space for text-to-3D, such as distillation time schedule and density initialization, which are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet not well explored.
- Extensive experiments on several datasets and qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed method, showing that it can generate high-fidelity and diverse 3D scenes from text.

Here is a summary of the method section:

```
The method section consists of four subsections: 3.1 Preliminaries, 3.2 Variational Score Distillation, 3.3 Design Space for Text-to-3D, and 3.4 Implementation Details.

In 3.1, the paper reviews the background of text-to-3D generation, diffusion models, and score distillation sampling (SDS).

In 3.2, the paper introduces variational score distillation (VSD), a new framework for text-to-3D generation that models the 3D parameter as a random variable and uses a particle-based variational inference technique to sample from the posterior distribution. The paper also shows that SDS is a special case of VSD and analyzes its limitations.

In 3.3, the paper discusses various improvements in the design space for text-to-3D, such as distillation time schedule and density initialization, which are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet not well explored.

In 3.4, the paper describes the implementation details of the proposed method, such as the network architectures, the training and inference procedures, and the evaluation metrics.

Here is a detailed pseudo code to implement the paper:

```
# Input: a text description x
# Output: a 3D scene y

# Pretrain a text-to-image diffusion model D on a large-scale dataset
# Use the architecture and training procedure from https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233
# Use the BigGAN model as the score network

# Pretrain a NeRF model N on a 3D dataset
# Use the architecture and training procedure from https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934
# Use the positional encoding and volume rendering techniques

# Initialize a 3D parameter z from N
# z is a vector of 256 dimensions
# z is obtained by averaging the latent codes of N for each view

# Define a score function S(x, z) based on D and N
# S(x, z) = log p(x|z) + log p(z)
# p(x|z) is the conditional distribution of images given z, modeled by D
# p(z) is the prior distribution of z, modeled by N

# Define a prior distribution p(z) based on N
# p(z) = N(0, I)

# Define a posterior distribution q(z|x) based on S and p
# q(z|x) = exp(S(x, z)) / Z(x)
# Z(x) is the normalizing constant

# Sample z from q(z|x) using variational score distillation (VSD)
# VSD consists of the following steps:
  # Initialize a set of particles Z = {z_1, ..., z_K} from q(z|x)
  # Use importance sampling with proposal distribution q_0(z|x) = N(z; mu, sigma)
  # mu and sigma are learned by an encoder network E(x)
  # Z = {E(x) + sigma * epsilon_k for k = 1 to K}
  # epsilon_k ~ N(0, I)

  # For t = 1 to T:
    # Sample noise epsilon from N(0, I)
    # Update each particle z_k using gradient descent on S(x, z_k + epsilon)
    # z_k = z_k - lr * grad_z S(x, z_k + epsilon)
    # lr is the learning rate

    # Resample particles Z from q(z|x) using importance sampling
    # Compute the weights w_k = exp(S(x, z_k)) / q_0(z_k|x)
    # Normalize the weights w_k = w_k / sum(w_k)
    # Sample indices i_1, ..., i_K from multinomial(w_1, ..., w_K)
    # Z = {z_i_1, ..., z_i_K}

  # Return the final particle z_T with the highest score
  # z_T = argmax_z S(x, z)

# Render the 3D scene y from z_T using N
# y = N(z_T, v)
# v is the view direction
