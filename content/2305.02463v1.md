Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: Shap-E is a conditional generative model for 3D assets that can produce both textured meshes and neural radiance fields as outputs.
- **Why**: Existing 3D generative models either produce a single output representation or require costly acquisition of implicit neural representations (INRs) for each sample in a dataset. Shap-E aims to overcome these limitations by directly generating the parameters of INRs that can be rendered in multiple ways.
- **How**: Shap-E consists of two stages: an encoder that maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function, and a conditional diffusion model that generates diverse samples from the encoder outputs. Shap-E can be conditioned on text or other modalities to produce 3D assets that match the given description. Shap-E is trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, and achieves comparable or better sample quality than Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **Shap-E**: A novel conditional generative model for 3D assets that can produce both textured meshes and neural radiance fields as outputs, by directly generating the parameters of implicit functions.
- **Encoder**: A deterministic encoder that maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function, which can be used to construct and render 3D assets in a differentiable manner.
- **Conditional diffusion model**: A conditional diffusion model that generates diverse samples from the encoder outputs, by adding and removing noise in a Markov chain. The model can be conditioned on text or other modalities to produce 3D assets that match the given description.
- **Dataset**: A large dataset of paired 3D and text data, consisting of over 100K samples from various domains such as animals, furniture, vehicles, and buildings.
- **Experiments**: A comprehensive evaluation of Shap-E on various metrics such as sample quality, diversity, fidelity, and conditional generation. The results show that Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality than Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds. The paper also showcases several applications of Shap-E such as style transfer, shape editing, and text-to-3D generation.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **Encoder**: The encoder takes a 3D asset as input and outputs the parameters of an implicit function that can represent both a textured mesh and a neural radiance field. The encoder consists of three submodules: a point cloud encoder, a texture encoder, and an implicit function encoder. The point cloud encoder extracts features from a set of 3D points sampled from the input mesh. The texture encoder extracts features from a set of 2D patches sampled from the input texture map. The implicit function encoder combines the features from the point cloud and texture encoders and outputs the parameters of an implicit function that can be queried at any 3D coordinate to obtain color, signed distance, and vertex offset values. The encoder is trained by minimizing the reconstruction loss between the input and output meshes and neural radiance fields.
- **Conditional diffusion model**: The conditional diffusion model takes the output of the encoder as input and generates diverse samples by adding and removing noise in a Markov chain. The model consists of two networks: a forward network and a reverse network. The forward network predicts the noise distribution at each step of the diffusion process, given the previous noise level and the conditioning information. The reverse network predicts the distribution over the original data, given the final noise level and the conditioning information. The model is trained by maximizing the variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data, given the conditioning information. The model can be conditioned on text or other modalities to generate 3D assets that match the given description.
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of over 100K samples of paired 3D and text data, collected from various sources such as ShapeNet [7], PartNet [63], Pix3D [66], Google 3D Warehouse [1], and Wikipedia [71]. Each sample contains a 3D mesh with texture map, a neural radiance field rendered from multiple views, and a text description of the 3D asset. The dataset covers various domains such as animals, furniture, vehicles, and buildings.
