Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak supervision by leveraging the semantic information encoded in the latent space of pre-trained GANs.
- **Why**: The paper aims to solve regression tasks on datasets and attributes that are difficult to produce quality supervision for, such as facial age estimation, facial expression intensity estimation, and image quality assessment.
- **How**: The paper exploits the observation that GANs learn smooth, linear, and disentangled directions in their latent space that affect image attributes in a consistent manner. The paper shows that the magnitude of change induced on the respective attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along these directions. The paper then uses these latent distances as regression targets and trains a simple linear model to predict them from input images. The paper also shows how to use these latent distances to sort images by the strength of given attributes without explicit supervision. The paper evaluates the method on various domains and tasks and compares it with state-of-the-art methods.

## Main Contributions

- A novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak supervision by leveraging the semantic information encoded in the latent space of pre-trained GANs.
- A simple and effective way to use latent distances as regression targets and train a linear model to predict them from input images.
- A demonstration of how to use latent distances to sort images by the strength of given attributes without explicit supervision.
- An extensive experimental evaluation on various domains and tasks, showing that the method achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when compared to methods designed to tackle a single task.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The method consists of three main steps: latent direction discovery, latent distance computation, and regression model training.
- **Latent direction discovery**: The method uses existing frameworks to discover latent directions that affect image attributes in a pre-trained GAN. The method assumes that these directions are smooth, linear, and disentangled in the latent space. The method can leverage different frameworks depending on the task and the domain, such as SeFa[^1^][1], StyleFlow[^2^][2], or GANSpace[^3^][3].
- **Latent distance computation**: The method computes the latent distance of an input image along a given direction as the distance between the original latent code and the projected latent code that lies on the direction. The method shows that this distance is approximately linear with respect to the magnitude of change induced on the respective attribute. The method uses these distances as regression targets for training a linear model.
- **Regression model training**: The method trains a simple linear model to predict the latent distances from input images. The model consists of a feature extractor and a linear layer. The feature extractor can be any pre-trained network, such as ResNet or VGG. The linear layer maps the extracted features to a scalar value that represents the predicted latent distance. The model is trained using mean squared error loss and a small number of labeled samples.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a pre-trained GAN, a latent direction discovery framework, a feature extractor, a regression task, and a set of labeled samples
# Output: a trained regression model

# Step 1: Latent direction discovery
direction = discover_latent_direction(GAN, framework)

# Step 2: Latent distance computation
distances = []
for image in labeled_samples:
  # Encode the image to the latent space
  latent_code = GAN.encode(image)
  # Project the latent code to the direction
  projected_code = project(latent_code, direction)
  # Compute the distance between the codes
  distance = norm(latent_code - projected_code)
  # Append the distance to the list
  distances.append(distance)

# Step 3: Regression model training
model = LinearModel(feature_extractor)
loss_function = MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = Adam()
for epoch in epochs:
  for image, distance in zip(labeled_samples, distances):
    # Extract features from the image
    features = feature_extractor(image)
    # Predict the distance from the features
    predicted_distance = model(features)
    # Compute the loss
    loss = loss_function(predicted_distance, distance)
    # Update the model parameters
    optimizer.step(loss)
