Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for improving the compositional reasoning performance of Vision and Language (VL) models, such as CLIP [^2^][2], by using Dense and Aligned Captions (DAC) that are more descriptive and accurate than the standard captions in existing datasets.
- **Why**: The paper argues that the current VL models suffer from the "object bias" problem, which means they tend to focus on the nouns (objects) in the images and texts, while ignoring or downsizing the attributes, relations, and states of objects that are essential for compositional reasoning. The paper claims that this problem is partly caused by the properties of the paired VL dataset used for finetuning and pre-training the VL model: (i) the caption quality, or in other words "image-alignment", of the texts; and (ii) the "density" of the captions in the sense of mentioning all the details appearing on the image.
- **How**: The paper introduces a fine-tuning approach that leverages a standard VL dataset (CC3M) and automatically treats these two factors by generating DAC for each image-text pair. DAC are captions that are more dense and aligned than the original ones, meaning they contain more information and are more consistent with the image content. The paper uses a two-stage process to generate DAC: first, it uses an off-the-shelf captioning model to generate a dense caption for each image; second, it uses a text-to-text transformer model to align the dense caption with the original text by paraphrasing or adding details. The paper then fine-tunes CLIP on the DAC dataset and evaluates its compositional reasoning performance on several benchmarks, such as COCO-Attributes [^3^][3], VQA-CP , and Flickr30k Entities . The paper shows that DAC significantly improves CLIP's performance on these tasks, compared to the base model and other baselines.

According to the paper at [^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel fine-tuning approach for improving the compositional reasoning performance of VL models by using DAC**. The paper shows that DAC can effectively address the two factors that limit the VL models' performance: caption quality and density. The paper also demonstrates that DAC can be generated automatically using existing models and datasets, without requiring additional human annotations or supervision.
- **A comprehensive evaluation of DAC on several compositional reasoning benchmarks**. The paper evaluates the performance of CLIP fine-tuned on DAC on various tasks that require understanding the attributes, relations, and states of objects in images and texts, such as COCO-Attributes [^2^][3], VQA-CP , and Flickr30k Entities . The paper shows that DAC significantly improves CLIP's performance on these tasks, compared to the base model and other baselines, such as CLIP+VQA  and CLIP+VCR .
- **A qualitative analysis of DAC and its impact on the VL representations**. The paper provides several examples of DAC and their corresponding image-text pairs, illustrating how DAC can enhance the alignment and density of the captions. The paper also visualizes the VL representations learned by CLIP fine-tuned on DAC, showing how they capture more compositional aspects of the images and texts than the base model.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **DAC generation**: The paper describes a two-stage process for generating DAC for each image-text pair in the CC3M dataset. The first stage is to generate a dense caption for each image using an off-the-shelf captioning model (Up-Down ). The second stage is to align the dense caption with the original text using a text-to-text transformer model (T5 ) that is fine-tuned on a paraphrasing task. The alignment process involves paraphrasing or adding details to the dense caption based on the original text, while preserving the image content and the grammatical correctness. The paper provides several examples of DAC and their corresponding image-text pairs, illustrating how DAC can enhance the alignment and density of the captions.
- **CLIP fine-tuning**: The paper fine-tunes CLIP [^2^][2] on the DAC dataset using a contrastive learning objective that maximizes the cosine similarity between the image and text embeddings of each DAC pair, while minimizing it for negative pairs. The paper uses the same hyperparameters and optimizer as in the original CLIP paper, except for reducing the batch size and learning rate due to memory constraints. The paper also fine-tunes CLIP on other datasets, such as COCO-Captions , VQA  , and VCR  , for comparison purposes.
- **Compositional reasoning evaluation**: The paper evaluates the performance of CLIP fine-tuned on DAC on several compositional reasoning benchmarks that require understanding the attributes, relations, and states of objects in images and texts. These benchmarks include COCO-Attributes [^3^][3], which measures the ability to recognize object attributes; VQA-CP , which measures the ability to answer visual questions that involve compositional reasoning; and Flickr30k Entities , which measures the ability to localize entities in images based on textual descriptions. The paper compares the performance of CLIP fine-tuned on DAC with the base model and other baselines, such as CLIP+VQA  and CLIP+VCR , showing that DAC significantly improves CLIP's performance on these tasks. The paper also provides qualitative examples of how DAC affects the VL representations learned by CLIP, showing that they capture more compositional aspects of the images and texts than the base model.
