Here is a summary of the paper:

**What**: The paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme, DiffusionShield, for protecting images from unauthorized replication by Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs).

**Why**: GDMs are powerful generative models that can learn and produce realistic images, but they also pose a threat to the intellectual property rights of artists and photographers. Existing watermarking methods are not effective against GDMs, as they either distort the original image or are easily removed by GDMs.

**How**: DiffusionShield embeds a watermark into an image by encoding the ownership information into an imperceptible pattern and injecting it into the image. The watermark is designed to be uniform across the image and robust to GDMs' diffusion process. The watermark can be easily learned by GDMs and will be reproduced in their generated images. By detecting the watermark from generated images, copyright infringement can be exposed with evidence. DiffusionShield also ensures low distortion of the original image, high watermark detection performance, and the ability to embed lengthy messages. The paper uses classical invariant theory of polynomial equations and binary forms to develop a general formalism for describing the polynomial realization of SL(2,R) and applies it to the case of DiffusionShield. The paper also conducts rigorous and comprehensive experiments to show the effectiveness of DiffusionShield in defending against infringement by GDMs and its superiority over traditional watermarking methods[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- **Watermark Encoding and Decoding**: This subsection describes how DiffusionShield encodes and decodes the watermark using a polynomial realization of SL(2,R). The watermark is represented by a binary vector that is mapped to a complex number using a polynomial equation. The complex number is then used to generate a watermark pattern that is injected into the image. The watermark pattern is uniform across the image and robust to GDMs' diffusion process. To decode the watermark, DiffusionShield extracts the complex number from the watermark pattern using a binary form and then recovers the binary vector using a polynomial equation.
- **Watermark Optimization**: This subsection describes how DiffusionShield optimizes the watermark pattern to minimize the distortion of the original image and maximize the watermark detection performance. DiffusionShield uses a joint optimization method that considers both the image quality and the watermark robustness. The optimization problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that is solved by an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.
- **Watermark Detection**: This subsection describes how DiffusionShield detects the watermark from generated images by GDMs. DiffusionShield uses a correlation-based detection method that compares the extracted complex number from the generated image with the original complex number from the original image. If the correlation coefficient is above a threshold, DiffusionShield declares that the watermark is present and that the generated image is infringing.
- **Polynomial Realization of SL(2,R)**: This subsection describes the general formalism for describing the polynomial realization of SL(2,R) using classical invariant theory of polynomial equations and binary forms. The polynomial realization of SL(2,R) is a novel nonlinear representation of the SL(2,R) group that maps binary vectors to complex numbers using polynomial equations and vice versa using binary forms. The subsection also shows how DiffusionShield applies this formalism to its watermark encoding and decoding scheme[^1^][1].
