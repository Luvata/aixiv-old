Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper proposes a framework named **StyleFaceV** for realistic generative face video synthesis using pretrained StyleGAN3.
- Why: The paper aims to tackle the challenges of low-quality frames, identity drift, and unnatural movements in existing face video generation methods.
- How: The paper decomposes appearance and pose information and recomposes them in the latent space of StyleGAN3 to produce stable and dynamic results. The paper also builds a temporal-dependent model to sample reasonable sequences of motions. The paper trains the pipeline on both static images and high-quality video data with a joint training strategy.

- The paper introduces a decomposition and recomposition design that allows for the disentangled combination of facial appearance and movements in the latent space of StyleGAN3.
- The paper develops a temporal-dependent model that samples reasonable sequences of motions and generates realistic and temporally coherent face videos.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper presents the overall framework of StyleFaceV, which consists of three components: a **decomposition module**, a **recomposition module**, and a **temporal-dependent model**.
- The decomposition module takes a face image as input and extracts its appearance and pose information in the latent space of StyleGAN3. The appearance information is represented by a style code, and the pose information is represented by a latent code.
- The recomposition module takes a style code and a latent code as input and synthesizes a face image with the corresponding appearance and pose. The recomposition module also has a feedback mechanism that refines the latent code to match the target pose better.
- The temporal-dependent model takes a sequence of latent codes as input and outputs a sequence of motions that are realistic and temporally coherent. The temporal-dependent model is based on an autoregressive recurrent neural network with attention mechanism.
- The paper trains the pipeline with a joint training strategy that optimizes four objectives: an identity loss, a reconstruction loss, an adversarial loss, and a motion loss. The paper uses both static images and high-quality video data for training.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper at :

```python
# Input: a face image I
# Output: a face video V

# Decompose the face image into appearance and pose information
style_code, latent_code = decomposition_module(I)

# Initialize an empty list for storing the face video frames
V = []

# Loop for a fixed number of frames
for t in range(T):

  # Sample a latent code for the next frame using the temporal-dependent model
  latent_code_t = temporal_dependent_model(latent_code)

  # Recompose the face image with the style code and the latent code
  I_t = recomposition_module(style_code, latent_code_t)

  # Append the face image to the face video list
  V.append(I_t)

# Return the face video
return V
