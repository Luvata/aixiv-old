Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for customizing text-to-image models to generate new concepts from a few examples, and to compose multiple new concepts together.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing text-to-image models that cannot synthesize personal or novel concepts that are unseen during large-scale training, and that tend to forget or change the meanings of existing concepts when fine-tuned on new ones.
- **How**: The paper introduces Custom Diffusion, an efficient method that only optimizes a few parameters in the text-to-image conditioning mechanism to represent new concepts while enabling fast tuning. The paper also proposes a way to jointly train for multiple concepts or combine multiple fine-tuned models into one via closed-form constrained optimization. The paper evaluates the method on several datasets and metrics, and shows that it outperforms several baselines and concurrent works.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper builds on the text-to-image diffusion model , which generates images by reversing a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to an image until it becomes pure noise. The model is conditioned on a text prompt via a learned embedding that modulates the noise level and the diffusion coefficients at each step.
- The paper proposes to fine-tune only the text embedding module of the pre-trained model on a few images of a new concept, while keeping the rest of the model fixed. The paper argues that this is sufficient to represent new concepts and enables fast tuning, as the text embedding module has relatively few parameters and can be optimized with gradient descent.
- The paper also proposes a method for composing multiple new concepts together, either by jointly training for multiple concepts with a shared text embedding module, or by combining multiple fine-tuned models into one via closed-form constrained optimization. The paper introduces a new modifier token V to denote personal categories and allow for flexible composition with existing concepts.
- The paper evaluates the method on several datasets and metrics, such as FID , LPIPS , and human preference scores. The paper shows that the method can generate diverse and realistic images of new concepts and compose them with existing concepts in novel settings. The paper also compares the method with several baselines and concurrent works, such as Few-Shot VQGAN [^1^][1], CLIP-Draw [^2^][2], and DALL-E , and demonstrates that the method outperforms them in terms of quality, diversity, and efficiency.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
model = load_pretrained_model()

# Fine-tune the text embedding module on a few images of a new concept
text_embedding = model.text_embedding
images = load_images_of_new_concept()
text_prompt = "A new concept"
text_embedding = fine_tune(text_embedding, images, text_prompt)

# Generate an image of the new concept from the text prompt
image = model.generate(text_prompt)

# Compose multiple new concepts together by combining multiple fine-tuned models
models = [model1, model2, ...] # fine-tuned models for different concepts
text_prompts = ["A new concept 1", "A new concept 2", ...] # text prompts for different concepts
image = compose(models, text_prompts) # combine the models via closed-form constrained optimization
```


## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
model = load_pretrained_model()
# The model consists of a text embedding module, a diffusion network, and a classifier network
text_embedding = model.text_embedding # a linear layer that maps a text prompt to a latent vector
diffusion = model.diffusion # a U-Net that predicts the noise level and the diffusion coefficients at each step
classifier = model.classifier # a linear layer that maps the final image to a class label

# Fine-tune the text embedding module on a few images of a new concept
images = load_images_of_new_concept() # a list of images of the new concept
text_prompt = "A new concept" # a text prompt for the new concept
optimizer = Adam(text_embedding.parameters()) # an optimizer for the text embedding module
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for image in images:
    # Run the diffusion process in reverse to generate an image from noise
    x_T = torch.randn_like(image) # initialize the image with pure noise
    for t in reversed(range(T)): # loop over the diffusion steps in reverse order
      z_t = diffusion(x_T, t) # predict the noise level and the diffusion coefficients at step t
      x_t = (x_T - z_t.mu_t) / z_t.sigma_t # reverse the noise addition at step t
      x_t = x_t + torch.randn_like(x_t) * sqrt(dt) # add Gaussian noise at step t
      x_T = x_t # update the image at step t
    
    # Compute the loss for fine-tuning the text embedding module
    y = text_embedding(text_prompt) # embed the text prompt to a latent vector
    logits = classifier(x_0) # predict the class label from the final image
    loss = cross_entropy(logits, y) # compute the cross entropy loss between the prediction and the embedding
    
    # Update the text embedding module parameters
    optimizer.zero_grad() # reset the gradients
    loss.backward() # compute the gradients
    optimizer.step() # update the parameters

# Generate an image of the new concept from the text prompt
image = model.generate(text_prompt) # use the model's generate function with the fine-tuned text embedding module

# Compose multiple new concepts together by combining multiple fine-tuned models
models = [model1, model2, ...] # fine-tuned models for different concepts
text_prompts = ["A new concept 1", "A new concept 2", ...] # text prompts for different concepts

# Initialize an image with pure noise
x_T = torch.randn(3, H, W) # H and W are the height and width of the image

# Loop over the diffusion steps in reverse
for t in reversed(range(T)):
  # Predict the noise level and the diffusion coefficients from each model at step t
  z_ts = [model.diffusion(x_T, t) for model in models]
  
  # Combine the predictions via closed-form constrained optimization
  mu_t = torch.stack([z_t.mu_t for z_t in z_ts]) # stack the mean predictions from each model
  sigma_t = torch.stack([z_t.sigma_t for z_t in z_ts]) # stack the standard deviation predictions from each model
  alpha = optimize_alpha(mu_t, sigma_t) # optimize alpha, a vector of weights for each model, using gradient descent with constraints
  mu_t = torch.sum(alpha * mu_t, dim=0) # compute the weighted average of mean predictions
  sigma_t = torch.sqrt(torch.sum(alpha * sigma_t ** 2, dim=0)) # compute the weighted average of variance predictions
  
  # Reverse the noise addition at step t using the combined predictions
  x_t = (x_T - mu_t) / sigma_t
  
  # Add Gaussian noise at step t
  x_t = x_t + torch.randn_like(x_t) * sqrt(dt)
  
  # Update the image at step t
  x_T = x_t

# The final image is x_0, which is composed of multiple new concepts together
