Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new subject-driven text-to-image generation model called BLIP-Diffusion, which can create novel images of an input subject based on text prompts.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing models, such as lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity, and to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.
- **How**: The paper introduces a new multimodal encoder that is pre-trained to provide subject representation, and a diffusion model that leverages the visual representation to generate new subject renditions. The paper also shows how to combine BLIP-Diffusion with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt for multimodal control.


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A new subject-driven text-to-image generation model called BLIP-Diffusion, which supports multimodal control and consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts.
- A new multimodal encoder that is pre-trained to provide subject representation, following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text.
- A new subject representation learning task that enables a diffusion model to leverage the visual representation and generate new subject renditions.
- A demonstration of zero-shot subject-driven generation and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth.
- A demonstration of novel subject-driven generation and editing applications by combining BLIP-Diffusion with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces a new multimodal encoder that is pre-trained to provide subject representation, following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. The encoder consists of a text encoder, an image encoder and a cross-modal attention module. The text encoder is a transformer that encodes the text prompt into a sequence of embeddings. The image encoder is a convolutional neural network that extracts features from the subject image. The cross-modal attention module computes the attention weights between the text and image embeddings and outputs a fused representation.
- The paper also introduces a new subject representation learning task that enables a diffusion model to leverage the visual representation and generate new subject renditions. The diffusion model is based on the denoising score matching framework, which learns to estimate the score function of the data distribution from noisy samples. The paper modifies the diffusion model to take both the text prompt and the subject image as inputs, and to output a noise level-dependent score function. The paper also proposes a new loss function that incorporates both reconstruction and diversity terms.
- The paper shows how to combine BLIP-Diffusion with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt for multimodal control. ControlNet is a neural network that predicts control parameters for the diffusion model based on the text prompt. Prompt-to-prompt is a technique that generates intermediate text prompts from an initial text prompt to guide the diffusion process. The paper demonstrates how these techniques can be used to control the style, pose, expression and background of the subject images.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```
# Pre-train the multimodal encoder
for each text-image pair in the pre-training dataset:
  encode the text into a sequence of embeddings using a transformer
  encode the image into a feature map using a CNN
  compute the cross-modal attention weights between the text and image embeddings
  output a fused representation by applying the attention weights
  minimize the contrastive loss between the fused representation and the image feature map

# Train the diffusion model
for each text-image pair in the training dataset:
  for each noise level from high to low:
    add Gaussian noise to the image according to the noise level
    encode the text and the noisy image using the pre-trained multimodal encoder
    output a score function that estimates the gradient of the log data density
    minimize the denoising score matching loss between the score function and the true gradient
    add a reconstruction loss term to encourage fidelity to the original image
    add a diversity loss term to encourage variation among different noise levels

# Generate new subject renditions
given an initial text prompt and a subject image:
  for each noise level from high to low:
    add Gaussian noise to the image according to the noise level
    encode the text and the noisy image using the pre-trained multimodal encoder
    sample a new image by following the score function using Langevin dynamics
    optionally, use ControlNet to predict control parameters for the score function based on the text prompt
    optionally, use prompt-to-prompt to generate intermediate text prompts to guide the generation process
  return the final image as the new subject rendition
