Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm for Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) to enhance the visual grounding ability of cross-modal models.
- **Why**: The paper observes that VLP models often lack the visual grounding/localization capability which is critical for many downstream tasks such as visual reasoning.
- **How**: The paper divides the image into blocks, and identifies the objects in each block through an object detector. It then reformulates the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given object. The paper introduces PTP into several state-of-the-art VLP frameworks and shows significant improvements on various benchmarks.

According to the paper at [^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm** for Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) that improves the visual grounding capability of cross-modal models by reformulating the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP.
- **Consistent and significant improvements** across representative cross-modal learning model architectures and several benchmarks, such as zero-shot Flickr30K Retrieval, COCO Captioning, and VQA 2.0.
- **Comparable results with object-detector based methods** and much faster inference speed since PTP discards its object detector for inference while the later cannot.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces the **Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP)** paradigm, which consists of two components: a **PTP generator** and a **PTP learner**.
- The PTP generator takes an image as input and divides it into N x N blocks. It then uses an object detector to identify the objects in each block and generates a PTP for each object. A PTP is a text prompt that contains a position placeholder [P] and an object placeholder [O], such as "The block [P] has a [O]".
- The PTP learner is a cross-modal model that takes an image and a PTP as input and learns to fill in the placeholders with the correct position and object. The paper uses three representative cross-modal model architectures: region feature based VLP (RF-VLP), end-to-end VLP (E2E-VLP), and transformer based VLP (T-VLP).
- The paper defines two types of PTP learning tasks: **object prediction** and **position regression**. In object prediction, the position placeholder is filled with a specific block index and the model has to predict the object in that block. In position regression, the object placeholder is filled with a specific object name and the model has to regress the block index of that object.
- The paper pre-trains the PTP learner on large-scale image-caption data using PTP learning tasks as auxiliary objectives along with contrastive learning and masked language modeling. The paper then fine-tunes the PTP learner on downstream tasks such as image retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering.
