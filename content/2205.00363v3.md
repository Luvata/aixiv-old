Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a dataset called Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR), which contains more than 10k natural text-image pairs with 66 types of spatial relations in English (such as: under, in front of, facing).
- **Why**: The paper aims to test the ability of vision-and-language models (VLMs) to capture spatial relations, which are a basic part of human cognition and natural language expression. The paper argues that existing benchmarks are not ideal for probing VLMs as they conflate multiple sources of error and do not allow controlled analysis on specific linguistic or cognitive properties.
- **How**: The paper collects natural images from Flickr and annotates them with spatial relations using a simple format. The paper also analyzes the linguistic phenomena and challenges in the dataset, such as varying reference frames and orientations of objects. The paper evaluates several state-of-the-art VLMs on the dataset and shows that they perform poorly compared to human performance. The paper also provides a fine-grained analysis of the model errors by relation type and image complexity.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- The creation of VSR, a large-scale dataset for testing VLMs on spatial reasoning with natural text-image pairs and 66 types of spatial relations.
- The analysis of the linguistic phenomena and challenges in VSR, such as varying reference frames and orientations of objects.
- The evaluation and fine-grained analysis of several state-of-the-art VLMs on VSR, showing a large gap between human and model performance and revealing the limitations of current models in capturing spatial relations.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the data collection and annotation process for VSR, which involves selecting natural images from Flickr and annotating them with spatial relations using a simple format. The paper also explains how they ensure the quality and diversity of the data, such as filtering out low-quality images, balancing the distribution of relation types, and sampling images with different levels of complexity.
- The paper introduces the task definition and evaluation metrics for VSR, which are based on a binary classification setting. The paper also defines several splits of the data for training, validation, and testing, such as by-relation splits and by-complexity splits, to allow fine-grained analysis of model performance.
- The paper presents the experimental setup and results for several state-of-the-art VLMs on VSR, such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019), and LXMERT (Tan and Bansal, 2019). The paper also compares the model performance with human performance and provides a detailed analysis of the model errors by relation type and image complexity. The paper discusses the limitations and challenges of current models in capturing spatial relations, such as varying reference frames and orientations of objects.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Data collection and annotation
images = select_images_from_Flickr()
relations = define_66_types_of_spatial_relations()
data = []
for image in images:
  # Filter out low-quality images
  if image.quality < threshold:
    continue
  # Annotate image with spatial relations
  annotation = annotate_image_with_relations(image, relations)
  # Balance the distribution of relation types
  if data.count(annotation.relation) < max_count:
    data.append(annotation)
# Sample images with different levels of complexity
data_by_complexity = split_data_by_complexity(data)

# Task definition and evaluation metrics
task = BinaryClassification(data.relation, data.text, data.image)
metric = Accuracy()

# Model training and testing
models = [CLIP(), ViLBERT(), LXMERT()]
for model in models:
  # Train model on training split
  model.train(data.train)
  # Test model on test split and by-relation split
  results = model.test(data.test, data.by_relation)
  # Compare model performance with human performance
  human_results = human.test(data.test, data.by_relation)
  compare(results, human_results)
  # Analyze model errors by relation type and image complexity
  analyze_errors(results, data.by_relation, data_by_complexity)
