Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper explores the visual interpretability of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which is a method to learn rich representations from natural language supervision. It proposes a new technique called Explainable CLIP (ECLIP) to improve the explainability of CLIP and avoid semantic shift.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide visual explanations of CLIP's predictions and to understand its limitations and biases. It finds that CLIP prefers background regions over foregrounds and shows erroneous visualization results against human understanding. It also identifies the pooling part as the source of semantic shift, which is a phenomenon where the model's attention shifts from the relevant objects to irrelevant ones.
- **How**: The paper introduces a new metric called Image-Text Similarity Map (ITSM) to visualize the similarity between image regions and text queries. Based on ITSM, it proposes ECLIP, which corrects the explainability of CLIP by using Masked Max Pooling instead of Attention Pooling. It also uses free attention as a guidance during training to focus on the confident foreground. It evaluates ECLIP on three datasets and shows that it outperforms previous explainability methods by large margins.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- It proposes a new metric called ITSM to visualize the similarity between image regions and text queries, which can reveal the visual explainability of CLIP and its limitations.
- It identifies the semantic shift problem in CLIP and attributes it to the inappropriate pooling methods used in the model.
- It proposes a new technique called ECLIP, which improves the explainability of CLIP by using Masked Max Pooling and free attention guidance. It also preserves the performance of CLIP on downstream vision tasks.
- It conducts extensive experiments on three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ECLIP over previous explainability methods.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of three parts:

- **Image-Text Similarity Map (ITSM)**: This is a metric to measure the similarity between image regions and text queries. It is computed by multiplying the image feature map and the text feature vector, and then applying a softmax function. It can be used to visualize the regions that the model pays attention to when predicting the text query.
- **Explainable CLIP (ECLIP)**: This is a technique to improve the explainability of CLIP by using Masked Max Pooling instead of Attention Pooling. Masked Max Pooling selects the maximum value from the image feature map after masking out the background regions. The background mask is obtained by applying a threshold to the free attention map, which is an intermediate output of CLIP. The free attention map indicates the confidence of each region being foreground or background. By using Masked Max Pooling, ECLIP can focus on the relevant objects and avoid semantic shift.
- **Training and Inference**: The paper describes how to train and infer ECLIP using the same data and loss function as CLIP. The only difference is that ECLIP uses Masked Max Pooling instead of Attention Pooling in both training and inference stages. The paper also explains how to generate the free attention map and how to set the threshold for masking.
