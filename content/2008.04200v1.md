Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach for text-guided image-to-image translation, which can manipulate visual attributes of images based on natural language commands.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenges of learning image manipulation without ground truth images and dealing with the ambiguity of natural language. The paper also wants to enable users to modify only specific attributes of an image without describing all the characteristics of the desired image.
- **How**: The paper introduces a model that disentangles the image content from the visual attributes, and learns to modify the latter using the textual description. The model then generates a new image from the content and the modified attribute representation. The model also produces multiple stochastic versions of the same translation to account for the uncertainty of natural language. The paper evaluates the model on two large-scale public datasets: CelebA and CUB.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces a **text-guided image-to-image translation model** that consists of three main components: a **content encoder**, an **attribute encoder**, and a **decoder**.
- The **content encoder** takes an input image and extracts its content representation, which is invariant to the visual attributes of the image. The content representation is then fed to the decoder to generate a new image.
- The **attribute encoder** takes an input image and a textual description, and encodes them into an attribute representation, which captures the visual attributes of the image that need to be modified according to the text. The attribute representation is also fed to the decoder to generate a new image.
- The **decoder** takes the content representation and the attribute representation, and combines them to produce a new image that satisfies the textual description. The decoder also introduces stochasticity in the generation process by sampling from a Gaussian distribution, which allows it to produce multiple plausible versions of the same translation.
- The paper proposes a **novel attribute representation learning method** that leverages two types of losses: a **text-image consistency loss** and an **attribute disentanglement loss**. The text-image consistency loss ensures that the attribute representation is consistent with both the input image and the textual description. The attribute disentanglement loss ensures that the attribute representation is orthogonal to the content representation, and that it only encodes the attributes that need to be changed according to the text.
- The paper also proposes a **novel stochastic image generation method** that leverages two types of losses: a **cycle-consistency loss** and a **diversity loss**. The cycle-consistency loss ensures that the generated image can be translated back to the original image using the opposite textual description. The diversity loss encourages the model to produce diverse outputs for the same input by penalizing similar images.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the content encoder, attribute encoder and decoder networks
content_encoder = ContentEncoder()
attribute_encoder = AttributeEncoder()
decoder = Decoder()

# Define the text-image consistency loss, attribute disentanglement loss, cycle-consistency loss and diversity loss functions
text_image_consistency_loss = TextImageConsistencyLoss()
attribute_disentanglement_loss = AttributeDisentanglementLoss()
cycle_consistency_loss = CycleConsistencyLoss()
diversity_loss = DiversityLoss()

# Define the optimizer for the model parameters
optimizer = Optimizer()

# Loop over the training data
for image, text in data:

  # Encode the image content and attribute
  content = content_encoder(image)
  attribute = attribute_encoder(image, text)

  # Generate a new image by decoding the content and attribute
  new_image = decoder(content, attribute)

  # Compute the text-image consistency loss and attribute disentanglement loss
  tic_loss = text_image_consistency_loss(new_image, text, attribute)
  ad_loss = attribute_disentanglement_loss(content, attribute)

  # Generate a reconstructed image by decoding the content and the opposite attribute
  opposite_text = get_opposite_text(text)
  opposite_attribute = attribute_encoder(image, opposite_text)
  reconstructed_image = decoder(content, opposite_attribute)

  # Compute the cycle-consistency loss and diversity loss
  cc_loss = cycle_consistency_loss(image, reconstructed_image)
  dv_loss = diversity_loss(new_image, reconstructed_image)

  # Compute the total loss as a weighted sum of the four losses
  total_loss = tic_loss + ad_loss + cc_loss + dv_loss

  # Update the model parameters using the optimizer
  optimizer.step(total_loss)
```
