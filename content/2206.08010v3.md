Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents MoDi, a generative model that can unconditionally synthesize diverse human motions from a given distribution, trained on an extremely diverse, unstructured and unlabeled dataset[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of learning a motion prior from a diverse dataset, and to enable various applications such as semantic editing and crowd simulation[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper adapts the StyleGAN architecture to the motion domain, using 3D convolutions and skeleton-aware operators to capture the spatio-temporal structure of human motion. The paper also introduces an encoder and a mapping network that can invert real and generated motions into MoDi's latent space, respectively[^1^][1].

The paper claims the following contributions[^1^][1]:

- A generative model that can unconditionally synthesize diverse human motions from a given distribution, trained on an extremely diverse, unstructured and unlabeled dataset.
- A latent space that is well-behaved and highly semantic, enabling various applications such as semantic editing and crowd simulation.
- An encoder and a mapping network that can invert real and generated motions into the latent space, respectively, allowing for completion from prefix and spatial editing.
- A thorough study of potential operators for motion synthesis, showing that 3D convolutions and skeleton-aware operators are superior to 2D convolutions and non-skeleton-aware operators.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the data, model, and training details of MoDi, as well as the evaluation metrics and baselines used for comparison[^1^][1].
- The data consists of 3D human motion sequences from various sources, covering a wide range of actions and styles. The data is preprocessed to align the motions to a common skeleton and to normalize the root position and orientation[^1^][1].
- The model is based on StyleGAN, with modifications to suit the motion domain. The model consists of a mapping network, a style network, and a synthesis network. The mapping network maps random latent codes to intermediate latent codes. The style network applies adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) to modulate the intermediate latent codes. The synthesis network generates motion sequences using 3D convolutions and skeleton-aware operators[^1^][1].
- The training details include the loss functions, hyperparameters, and optimization methods used to train MoDi. The paper also describes how to train an encoder and a mapping network that can invert real and generated motions into the latent space[^1^][1].
- The evaluation metrics include Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the quality and diversity of generated motions, and Diversity Score (DS), which measures the diversity of generated motions within a cluster. The paper also uses qualitative evaluations such as visual inspection, semantic editing, and user study[^1^][1].
- The baselines include state-of-the-art methods for motion synthesis, such as MoGlow, VAE-GAN, and CVAE-GAN. The paper compares MoDi with these methods on various aspects such as quality, diversity, realism, and editing capabilities[^1^][1].
