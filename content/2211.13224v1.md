Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel technique called Peekaboo that can generate segmentation masks for images conditioned on natural language prompts, using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of semantic grounding, which is the task of localizing and identifying objects or regions in an image that correspond to a given natural language expression. Most existing methods for semantic grounding require human-annotated localization information or segmentation-specific training, which limits their applicability and scalability. The paper claims that Peekaboo is the first zero-shot, open-vocabulary, unsupervised semantic grounding technique that leverages diffusion-based generative models with no re-training.
- **How**: The paper introduces an inference time optimization process that exploits the denoising property of diffusion models to generate segmentation masks. Given an image and a natural language prompt, the process first generates a noisy image using a diffusion model conditioned on the prompt. Then, it iteratively refines the noisy image by applying a mask that preserves the regions that match the prompt and corrupts the rest. The final mask is obtained by thresholding the difference between the original and the noisy image. The paper evaluates Peekaboo on two datasets: Pascal VOC for unsupervised semantic segmentation and RefCOCO for referring segmentation. The paper reports that Peekaboo outperforms several baselines and achieves competitive results with supervised methods.

## Main Contributions

The paper lists the following contributions:

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model called **DALL-E Mini**[^1^][1] that can generate realistic images from natural language prompts. The model consists of a **vision-language transformer** that encodes the prompt and a **diffusion model** that generates the image.
- The paper introduces an inference time optimization process called **Peekaboo** that exploits the denoising property of diffusion models to generate segmentation masks. The process consists of three steps: **noising**, **masking**, and **thresholding**.
- The noising step generates a noisy image by sampling from the diffusion model conditioned on the prompt. The noisy image is expected to have higher fidelity in the regions that match the prompt and lower fidelity elsewhere.
- The masking step iteratively refines the noisy image by applying a mask that preserves the regions that match the prompt and corrupts the rest. The mask is initialized randomly and updated using gradient descent to minimize the reconstruction loss between the original and the noisy image. The mask acts as a soft attention mechanism that guides the diffusion model to focus on the relevant regions.
- The thresholding step obtains the final mask by thresholding the difference between the original and the noisy image. The threshold is chosen to maximize the intersection over union (IoU) score between the mask and a ground truth segmentation mask (if available). The final mask can be used to segment the original image or generate a new image conditioned on a different prompt.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
model = load_model("DALL-E Mini")

# Define the prompt and the image
prompt = "a cat wearing a hat"
image = load_image("cat.jpg")

# Generate a noisy image using the diffusion model
noisy_image = model.sample(prompt)

# Initialize a mask randomly
mask = random_mask()

# Define the number of iterations and the learning rate
num_iter = 100
lr = 0.01

# Define the reconstruction loss function
loss_fn = mean_squared_error

# Optimize the mask using gradient descent
for i in range(num_iter):
  # Preserve the regions that match the prompt and corrupt the rest
  masked_image = mask * noisy_image + (1 - mask) * corrupt(image)
  
  # Compute the reconstruction loss
  loss = loss_fn(image, masked_image)
  
  # Update the mask using gradient descent
  mask = mask - lr * gradient(loss, mask)

# Threshold the difference between the original and the noisy image
threshold = optimal_threshold(image, noisy_image)
final_mask = (image - noisy_image) > threshold

# Segment the original image or generate a new image using the final mask
segmented_image = final_mask * image
new_prompt = "a dog wearing a hat"
new_image = model.sample(new_prompt) * final_mask + image * (1 - final_mask)

# Define the prompt and the image
prompt = "a cat wearing a hat"
image = torchvision.io.read_image("cat.jpg")

# Resize the image to match the model input size (256 x 256)
image = torchvision.transforms.Resize((256, 256))(image)

# Normalize the image to the range [0, 1]
image = image / 255.0

# Generate a noisy image using the diffusion model
# The model returns a tensor of shape (1, 3, 256, 256)
noisy_image = model.sample(prompt)

# Initialize a mask randomly
# The mask is a tensor of shape (1, 1, 256, 256)
mask = torch.rand((1, 1, 256, 256))

# Define the number of iterations and the learning rate
num_iter = 100
lr = 0.01

# Define the reconstruction loss function
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

# Optimize the mask using gradient descent
for i in range(num_iter):

  # Update the mask using gradient descent
  # The clamp function ensures that the mask values are in [0, 1]
  mask = mask - lr * mask.grad
  mask = torch.clamp(mask, 0.0, 1.0)

# Threshold the difference between the original and the noisy image
# The optimal_threshold function computes the Otsu threshold
threshold = optimal_threshold(image - noisy_image)
final_mask = (image - noisy_image) > threshold

# Segment the original image or generate a new image using the final mask
segmented_image = final_mask * image
new_prompt = "a dog wearing a hat"
new_image = model.sample(new_prompt) * final_mask + image * (1 - final_mask)
