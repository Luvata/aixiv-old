Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper proposes a method to balance the reconstruction and editing quality of GAN inversion for real image editing with StyleGAN prior latent space.
- Why: The paper aims to address the trade-off between reconstruction quality and perceptual quality of the edited images, which is a challenge for existing GAN inversion methods that use unbounded latent spaces such as W or W+.
- How: The paper revisits the original latent space Z, which is a bounded hyperspherical space that can be easily editable, and extends it to Z+ by combining it with a feature space. The paper then integrates Z+ into seminal GAN inversion methods such as e4e and IDInvert to improve editing quality. The paper also projects the real images into Z+ and moves along Z+ to enable semantic editing without sacrificing image quality. The paper shows that Z+ can replace the commonly-used spaces such as W, W+, and S while preserving reconstruction quality and reducing distortion of edited images.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- The paper proposes a novel latent space Z+ that balances the reconstruction and editing quality of GAN inversion for real image editing with StyleGAN prior latent space.
- The paper integrates Z+ into existing GAN inversion methods such as e4e and IDInvert and shows that it improves the editing quality while preserving the reconstruction quality.
- The paper demonstrates that Z+ can replace the commonly-used spaces such as W, W+, and S and achieve sophisticated editing quality with the aid of the StyleGAN prior.
- The paper provides comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness and robustness of Z+ on various datasets and editing tasks.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- In subsection 3.1, the paper reviews the background of StyleGAN and its latent spaces, such as Z, W, W+, and S. The paper also introduces the concept of GAN inversion and latent space editing.
- In subsection 3.2, the paper proposes a novel latent space Z+ that combines the original latent space Z with a feature space F. The paper defines F as the output of the first convolutional layer of StyleGAN's generator. The paper shows that Z+ is a bounded hyperspherical space that can be easily editable and can leverage the StyleGAN prior.
- In subsection 3.3, the paper integrates Z+ into existing GAN inversion methods such as e4e and IDInvert. The paper modifies the loss functions and optimization procedures of these methods to incorporate Z+ and F. The paper also introduces a regularization term to enforce the consistency between Z+ and F.
- In subsection 3.4, the paper describes how to perform semantic editing on real images using Z+. The paper projects the real images into Z+ using the GAN inversion methods and then moves along Z+ to edit the images. The paper also explains how to use boundary-based editing and interface-based editing to control the editing direction and magnitude.

## Pseudo Code

Here is a possible pseudo code to implement this paper:

```
# Load a pre-trained StyleGAN generator G
# Define the feature space F as the output of the first convolutional layer of G
# Define the latent space Z+ as the concatenation of Z and F
# Define a perceptual loss Lp based on VGG network
# Define a regularization loss Lr to enforce the consistency between Z+ and F
# Define a total loss L as a weighted combination of Lp and Lr

# For each real image x, do the following:
  # Initialize a random latent code z in Z
  # Initialize a feature code f in F by passing z through G
  # Concatenate z and f to get z+ in Z+
  # Optimize z+ by minimizing L with respect to z+ using gradient descent
  # Obtain the reconstructed image x' by passing z+ through G
  # Obtain the inverted code z+* by clipping z+ to the range of Z+

# For each editing task, do the following:
  # Choose an editing direction d in Z+ (either boundary-based or interface-based)
  # Choose an editing magnitude m (either fixed or variable)
  # Move the inverted code z+* along d by adding m * d to z+*
  # Obtain the edited image x'' by passing z+* + m * d through G
