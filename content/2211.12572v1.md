Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a new framework for text-driven image-to-image translation using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide users with control over the generated content by allowing them to modify the semantic layout and appearance of a guidance image according to a target text prompt.
- **How**: The paper leverages the spatial features and self-attention inside the diffusion model to inject features extracted from the guidance image into the generation process of the target image, without any training or fine-tuning. The paper demonstrates high-quality results on various text-guided image translation tasks, such as translating sketches, changing object classes and modifying global qualities.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims to make the following contributions:

- A novel framework for text-driven image-to-image translation that harnesses the power of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and requires no training or fine-tuning.
- A simple and effective approach for manipulating spatial features and self-attention inside the diffusion model to achieve fine-grained control over the generated structure and appearance.
- A demonstration of high-quality results on versatile text-guided image translation tasks, including translating sketches, rough drawings and animations into realistic images, changing of the class and appearance of objects in a given image, and modifications of global qualities such as lighting and color.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of three subsections:

- Text-to-Image Diffusion Model: This subsection describes the diffusion model used for text-to-image synthesis, which is based on the CLIP score as a likelihood function and a U-Net architecture with self-attention blocks. The model is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of text-image pairs and can generate diverse and realistic images given a text prompt.
- Feature Extraction and Injection: This subsection explains how to extract spatial features from a guidance image and inject them into the diffusion model to generate a target image that complies with the target text prompt. The features are extracted from the encoder part of the U-Net and injected into the decoder part using a feature alignment module that matches the features based on their self-attention maps. The feature injection is controlled by a mixing coefficient that balances between the guidance image and the target text.
- Text-Guided Image Translation Tasks: This subsection presents various tasks that can be performed using the proposed framework, such as translating sketches, rough drawings and animations into realistic images, changing of the class and appearance of objects in a given image, and modifications of global qualities such as lighting and color. The subsection also discusses some limitations and challenges of the framework, such as handling complex scenes, preserving fine details and avoiding mode collapse.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: guidance image x, target text prompt t
# Output: target image y

# Load the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
model = load_model("diffusion_model.pth")

# Extract spatial features from the guidance image using the encoder part of the model
features_x = model.encoder(x)

# Generate a random noise image z
z = torch.randn_like(x)

# Initialize the target image y as z
y = z

# Loop over the diffusion steps from T to 1
for t in range(T, 0, -1):
  # Compute the mixing coefficient alpha based on the diffusion step
  alpha = compute_alpha(t)

  # Inject the features_x into the decoder part of the model using a feature alignment module and alpha
  features_y = model.decoder(y, features_x, alpha)

  # Compute the CLIP score between y and t
  score = clip_score(y, t)

  # Update y using the diffusion model and the score
  y = model.update(y, t, score)

# Return the target image y
return y
```

  # Compute the cosine similarity between the image and the text features
  similarity = torch.cosine_similarity(image_features, text_features, dim=-1)

  # Return the similarity scaled by gamma

  # Compute the loss function as the negative log-likelihood of the image given the mean, var and score
  loss = -torch.distributions.Normal(mean + score, var).log_prob(image)

  # Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the image
  grad = torch.autograd.grad(loss, image)[0]

  # Update the image using gradient descent with a small learning rate
  lr = 0.01
  image = image - lr * grad

  # Add Gaussian noise to the image with standard deviation sigma
  noise = torch.randn_like(image) * sigma
  image = image + noise

  features_x = model.encoder(guidance_image)

  # Generate a random noise image z with the same shape as guidance_image
  z = torch.randn_like(guidance_image)

  # Initialize the target image y as z

  # Loop over the diffusion steps from T to 1

    # Update y using model_update function with y, t and score as inputs
    y = model_update(y, t, score)

    # Print some progress information every 100 steps
    if t % 100 == 0:
      print(f"Diffusion step: {t}, Score: {score.item()}")

    # Save some intermediate images every 200 steps for visualization purposes (optional)
    if t % 200 == 0:
      torchvision.utils.save_image(y, f"image_{t}.png")

  
   # Return y as a PIL Image object
