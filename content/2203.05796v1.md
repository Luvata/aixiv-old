Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes CLIP-benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate, analyze, and benchmark CLIP and its variants. CLIP is a paradigm to learn visual models from language supervision using contrastive loss.

Why: The paper aims to address the challenges of reproducing and comparing different CLIP methods, which use different data, supervision, and model architectures. The paper also aims to provide insights and guidelines for future CLIP research.

How: The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of three key factors: data, supervision, and model architecture. The paper compares different data filtering strategies, different supervision methods (such as hard negative mining and label smoothing), and different model architectures (such as ConvNets and ViT). The paper also proposes a new variant called DeFILIP, which combines DeCLIP and FILIP.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The method section consists of three subsections: data, supervision, and model architecture.

Data: The paper compares different data filtering strategies for CLIP, such as using CLIP itself, DeCLIP, or human annotations. The paper also compares different data sources, such as YFCC100M, OpenImages, and Conceptual Captions. The paper finds that data quality has a significant impact on performance, and that DeCLIP can filter out noisy data more effectively than CLIP.

Supervision: The paper compares different supervision methods for CLIP, such as hard negative mining, label smoothing, and temperature scaling. The paper also compares different supervision levels, such as full supervision, weak supervision, and zero supervision. The paper finds that certain supervision has different effects for ConvNets and ViT, and that applying more proper supervision can effectively improve the performance of CLIP.

Model architecture: The paper compares different model architectures for CLIP, such as ConvNets (ResNet) and ViT. The paper also compares different text encoders for CLIP, such as BERT and DistilBERT. The paper finds that curtailing the text encoder reduces the training cost but not much affect the final performance, and that ViT outperforms ResNet in most cases.

Here is a high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```
# Define the image encoder, such as ViT or ResNet
image_encoder = ImageEncoder()

# Define the text encoder, such as BERT or DistilBERT
text_encoder = TextEncoder()

# Define the contrastive loss function, such as NT-Xent
contrastive_loss = ContrastiveLoss()

# Load the image-text pairs from different data sources, such as YFCC100M, OpenImages, or Conceptual Captions
image_text_pairs = load_data()

# Filter the image-text pairs using different strategies, such as CLIP, DeCLIP, or human annotations
filtered_image_text_pairs = filter_data(image_text_pairs)

# Apply different supervision methods to the image-text pairs, such as hard negative mining, label smoothing, or temperature scaling
supervised_image_text_pairs = supervise_data(filtered_image_text_pairs)

# Train the image and text encoders using the contrastive loss on the supervised image-text pairs
for image, text in supervised_image_text_pairs:
  # Encode the image and text into embeddings
  image_embedding = image_encoder(image)
  text_embedding = text_encoder(text)

  # Compute the contrastive loss between the image and text embeddings
  loss = contrastive_loss(image_embedding, text_embedding)

  # Update the parameters of the image and text encoders using gradient descent
  update_parameters(loss)
