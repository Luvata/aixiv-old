Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper presents a method called **DreamFusion** that can synthesize 3D models from text descriptions using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) renderer.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text-to-3D methods that require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D data and efficient architectures for denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors for 3D synthesis.
- **How**: The paper introduces a loss based on **probability density distillation** that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, the paper optimizes a randomly-initialized 3D model (a NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel technique for text-to-3D synthesis that leverages a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model and a NeRF renderer, without requiring any 3D training data or modifications to the image diffusion model.
- A novel loss function based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on various text prompts and comparisons with existing text-to-3D methods, showing that DreamFusion can generate realistic and diverse 3D models that match the text descriptions.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of three subsections:

- **2.1 Background on diffusion models and NeRFs**: This subsection reviews the basics of diffusion models and NeRFs, which are the main components of the proposed method. Diffusion models are generative models that learn to denoise images from a noisy diffusion process, and can be conditioned on text to synthesize images that match the text descriptions. NeRFs are implicit 3D representations that learn to map 3D coordinates and viewing directions to colors and densities, and can be rendered from any viewpoint using volume rendering.
- **2.2 Score Distillation Sampling**: This subsection introduces the novel loss function based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. The idea is to match the probability density of the image generator's output to that of the diffusion model's output, given the same text and noise inputs. The paper derives an unbiased estimator of this loss using score matching and Langevin dynamics, and shows how to compute it efficiently using a single forward pass through the diffusion model.
- **2.3 DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion**: This subsection describes the overall procedure of the proposed method, which consists of two steps: (1) optimizing a randomly-initialized NeRF using the score distillation sampling loss with respect to multiple 2D renderings from random viewpoints and lighting conditions, given a text prompt; and (2) rendering the optimized NeRF from any desired viewpoint and lighting condition using volume rendering. The paper also discusses some implementation details and tricks to improve the quality and diversity of the generated 3D models.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is a possible high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt t
# Output: a 3D model m that matches t

# Initialize a NeRF m with random weights
# Initialize a 2D text-to-image diffusion model d with pretrained weights
# Initialize a set of random viewpoints v and lighting conditions l

# Repeat for a fixed number of iterations:
  # Sample a random noise vector z
  # For each viewpoint v_i and lighting condition l_i in v and l:
    # Render a 2D image x_i from m using v_i and l_i
    # Compute the score distillation sampling loss L_i between x_i and d(t, z)
  # Update m by gradient descent to minimize the sum of L_i

# Return m as the final 3D model
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is a possible detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt t
# Output: a 3D model m that matches t

# Define the hyperparameters:
  # N: the number of optimization iterations
  # K: the number of viewpoints and lighting conditions
  # T: the number of diffusion steps
  # beta: the noise level for each diffusion step
  # alpha: the learning rate for gradient descent
  # sigma: the standard deviation of the Langevin dynamics

# Initialize a NeRF m with random weights
# Initialize a 2D text-to-image diffusion model d with pretrained weights
# Initialize a set of random viewpoints v and lighting conditions l of size K

# Repeat for n = 1 to N:
  # Sample a random noise vector z from a standard normal distribution
  # Initialize the loss L to zero
  # For k = 1 to K:
    # Render a 2D image x_k from m using v_k and l_k
    # Sample a random diffusion step t_k from {1, ..., T}
    # Compute the noisy image y_k = sqrt(1 - beta_t_k) * x_k + sqrt(beta_t_k) * z
    # Compute the score s_k = d.score(t_k, t, y_k) using a single forward pass through d
    # Compute the score matching term SM_k = (y_k - x_k) * s_k / (2 * beta_t_k)
    # Compute the Langevin dynamics term LD_k = sigma * s_k / sqrt(beta_t_k)
    # Compute the score distillation sampling loss L_k = -SM_k + LD_k^2 / 2
    # Add L_k to L
  # Update m by gradient descent to minimize L using alpha as the learning rate

# Return m as the final 3D model
