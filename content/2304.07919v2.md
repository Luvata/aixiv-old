Here is a summary of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07919v2:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel chain of thought prompt tuning for vision-language modeling, which approximates the human reasoning process by using multiple natural language prompts to tune visual models on complex tasks.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing language-image pre-training methods that only use a single prompt for tuning, neglecting the inherent step-to-step cognitive reasoning process that humans conduct in complex task settings, especially when processing images from unfamiliar domains.
- **How**: The paper introduces a chain of thought prompt tuning framework that consists of three components: (1) a prompt generator that generates a sequence of natural language prompts based on the task and the input image; (2) a prompt tuner that tunes the vision-language model with each prompt in the sequence; and (3) a prompt aggregator that aggregates the outputs of the prompt tuner to produce the final prediction. The paper evaluates the framework on various downstream tasks, such as image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, and shows that it outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, transferability, and domain adaptation.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07919v2:

- **Chain of Thought Prompt Tuning Framework**: The paper introduces a novel framework for vision-language modeling that consists of three components: a prompt generator, a prompt tuner, and a prompt aggregator. The framework takes an image and a task as inputs and produces a prediction as output.
- **Prompt Generator**: The prompt generator is responsible for generating a sequence of natural language prompts based on the task and the input image. The prompts are designed to guide the model to perform step-by-step reasoning on the image. The paper uses two types of prompt generators: a rule-based generator and a neural generator. The rule-based generator uses predefined templates and rules to generate prompts, while the neural generator uses a pre-trained language model to generate prompts conditioned on the task and the image.
- **Prompt Tuner**: The prompt tuner is responsible for tuning the vision-language model with each prompt in the sequence. The paper uses CLIP [12] as the base vision-language model, which learns joint embeddings of images and texts from natural language supervision. The prompt tuner fine-tunes CLIP with each prompt using contrastive learning, where the input image is treated as a positive example and other images are treated as negative examples. The prompt tuner outputs an embedding for each prompt, which represents the intermediate reasoning state of the model.
- **Prompt Aggregator**: The prompt aggregator is responsible for aggregating the outputs of the prompt tuner to produce the final prediction. The paper uses two types of prompt aggregators: a linear aggregator and an attention aggregator. The linear aggregator simply averages the embeddings of all prompts, while the attention aggregator computes a weighted average of the embeddings based on their relevance to the task. The final embedding is then fed into a classifier or a decoder to generate the prediction.
