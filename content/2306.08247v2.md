Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new framework for text-vision-conditioned image generation, called Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW), which synthesizes images based on both textual and visual inputs without any additional training.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods that either lose the pixel-level information of the visual input or require re-training the model for different visual conditions. The paper also claims that COW can achieve better speed, quality, and fidelity than learning-based methods.
- **How**: The paper leverages the diffusion model for text-to-image generation and introduces a cyclic process that repeatedly uses the visual input as a seed for the denoising process. The paper also controls the information flow from the visual input to the output image by using a mask and a gate function. The paper evaluates COW on two tasks: one-shot face synthesis and text-conditioned image synthesis, and compares it with several baselines.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A new text-vision-conditioned image generation setting** that allows users to create customized images based on both textual and visual inputs, without losing the pixel-level information of the visual input or requiring re-training the model for different visual conditions.
- **A novel framework, Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW)**, that leverages the diffusion model for text-to-image generation and introduces a cyclic process that repeatedly uses the visual input as a seed for the denoising process, while controlling the information flow from the visual input to the output image by using a mask and a gate function.
- **Extensive experiments** on two challenging tasks: one-shot face synthesis and text-conditioned image synthesis, demonstrating the superiority of COW in terms of speed, quality, and fidelity compared to learning-based text-vision conditional methods. The paper also provides ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and user studies to validate the effectiveness of COW.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first reviews the diffusion model for text-to-image generation, which consists of a forward diffusion process that adds noise to the image and a reverse denoising process that reconstructs the image from the noisy input based on the text condition.
- The paper then introduces the text-vision-conditioned image generation setting, where the goal is to synthesize an image that is consistent with both the textual and visual inputs. The paper defines two types of visual inputs: **visual guidance** and **visual constraint**. Visual guidance refers to the visual input that provides additional information or hints for the image generation, such as a sketch or a style image. Visual constraint refers to the visual input that imposes strict requirements or restrictions on the image generation, such as a face ID or a watermark.
- The paper then proposes Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW), a framework that leverages the diffusion model and introduces a cyclic process that repeatedly uses the visual input as a seed for the denoising process. The paper also controls the information flow from the visual input to the output image by using a mask and a gate function. The paper describes the details of COW as follows:
  - **Initialization**: The paper initializes the denoising process by using the visual input as a seed, which is either directly copied or randomly sampled from the visual input according to a mask. The mask is generated based on the type of visual input (guidance or constraint) and the desired level of preservation or modification. The paper also uses a gate function to control how much information from the visual input is passed to the output image at each step of the denoising process.
  - **Denoising**: The paper follows the standard denoising process of the diffusion model, which uses a neural network to predict the distribution of the clean image given the noisy input and the text condition. The paper also uses an annealing schedule to gradually reduce the noise level along the denoising process.
  - **Cycling**: The paper repeats the initialization and denoising steps multiple times to gradually but steadily impose the internal diffusion process within the image. The paper argues that this cyclic process can help achieve harmony among different sub-regions of the image and avoid mode collapse or artifacts. The paper also adapts the mask and gate function at each cycle according to different criteria, such as entropy, gradient, or similarity.
