Here is a summary of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09252v1:

- **What**: The paper proposes a one-stage object detection model called GridCLIP that leverages the vision-language foundation model CLIP to learn grid-level representations for detecting objects in images.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the performance of one-stage detectors on undersampled categories (infrequent and novel) by using CLIP's generalizable knowledge representation learned from large-scale image-text paired data.
- **How**: The paper introduces two alignment mechanisms: Grid-level Alignment and Image-level Alignment. Grid-level Alignment adapts the CLIP image-level representations to grid-level representations by aligning them to CLIP category representations. Image-level Alignment propagates the broad pre-learned categories in the CLIP image encoder from the image-level to the grid-level representations. The paper evaluates GridCLIP on the LVIS benchmark and shows comparable results to two-stage detectors.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09252v1:

- The paper adopts a one-stage detector framework that consists of a backbone network, a neck module, and a head module.
- The backbone network is the CLIP image encoder that extracts high-dimensional image embeddings from the input images.
- The neck module is a feature pyramid network (FPN) that fuses the multi-scale features from the backbone network and outputs grid-level image representations (also called feature maps).
- The head module is a RetinaNet-like detector that predicts the object categories and bounding boxes from the grid-level image representations.
- The paper introduces two alignment mechanisms to learn grid-level representations from CLIP: Grid-level Alignment and Image-level Alignment.
- Grid-level Alignment adapts the CLIP image-level representations to grid-level representations by aligning them to CLIP category representations. This is done by adding an extra linear layer on top of the CLIP image encoder and applying a cosine similarity loss between the grid-level representations and the CLIP category representations.
- Image-level Alignment propagates the broad pre-learned categories in the CLIP image encoder from the image-level to the grid-level representations. This is done by adding a skip connection between the output of the CLIP image encoder and the input of the FPN, and applying a cosine similarity loss between the image-level representation and the whole image embedding from the CLIP text encoder.
- The paper trains GridCLIP on the LVIS dataset using a multi-task loss that combines the alignment losses and the detection losses.
