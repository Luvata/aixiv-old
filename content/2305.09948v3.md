Here is a summary of the paper based on the first search result[^1^][1]:

- What: The paper introduces two new sets of data splits named **HICO-DET-SG** and **V-COCO-SG** based on **HICO-DET** and **V-COCO** datasets to evaluate **systematic generalization** in **Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection**.
- Why: The paper argues that systematic generalization, i.e., generalization to novel combinations of objects and interactions, is a challenging and important goal in HOI detection, but no open benchmark or existing work evaluates it.
- How: The paper creates the new data splits by dividing the original datasets into train and test sets such that the test set contains novel combinations of objects and interactions that are not seen in the train set. The paper then evaluates representative HOI detection models on the new data splits and observes large degradation in the test performances compared to those on the original datasets.

Here is a summary of the method section based on the second search result[^1^][2]:

- The paper describes how to create the new data splits named HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, respectively.
- The paper defines **novel combinations** of objects and interactions as those that do not appear in the train set but appear in the test set.
- The paper uses **split ratio** to control the degree of systematic generalization challenge, which is the ratio of novel combinations in the test set to all combinations in the test set.
- The paper creates **three splits** for each dataset with different split ratios: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8.
- The paper provides **statistics** of the new data splits, such as the number of images, instances, objects, interactions, and combinations in each split.
- The paper evaluates **four representative HOI detection models** on the new data splits: iCAN [9], InteractNet [10], GPNN [11], and PPDM [12].
- The paper uses **mean average precision (mAP)** as the evaluation metric and reports the results on both original and new data splits.
