Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a novel end-to-end trainable network for solving the blind Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem, which is the problem of estimating the camera pose relative to a scene, given 2D image points and 3D scene points, without prior knowledge of the 2D-3D correspondences[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing approaches that assume that noisy correspondences are provided, that a good pose prior is available, or that the problem size is small. The paper claims that their approach can solve the blind PnP problem efficiently and globally, without the need for pose priors[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper leverages recent results in differentiating optimization problems to incorporate geometric model fitting into an end-to-end learning framework, including Sinkhorn, RANSAC and PnP algorithms. The paper also proposes novel techniques for embedding non-differentiable robust estimation methods into the network. The paper evaluates their approach on synthetic and real datasets and shows that it outperforms other methods[^1^][1].

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the contributions are:

- The first fully end-to-end trainable network for solving the blind PnP problem efficiently and globally
- The novel deployment of geometric model fitting algorithms as declarative layers inside the network
- The novel embedding of non-differentiable robust estimation techniques into the network
- State-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a network architecture that consists of three main components: a feature extraction and matching module, a geometric model fitting module, and a PnP solver module[^1^][1].
- The feature extraction and matching module uses SuperPoint [47] to extract keypoints and descriptors from the 2D images, and SuperGlue [34] to match them with the 3D points using a learned affinity matrix[^1^][1].
- The geometric model fitting module uses Sinkhorn [8] to obtain soft correspondences from the affinity matrix, and RANSAC [23] to find the best pose hypothesis that fits the most correspondences[^1^][1].
- The PnP solver module uses EPnP [32] to refine the pose hypothesis using nonlinear optimization, and implicit differentiation [9] to backpropagate the gradients through the solver[^1^][1].
- The paper also introduces novel techniques for making RANSAC and EPnP differentiable, such as using soft inliers and soft residuals, and using a smooth approximation of the rotation matrix[^1^][1].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: 2D image points x, 3D scene points X
# Output: camera pose R, t

# Feature extraction and matching
k, d = SuperPoint(x) # keypoints and descriptors
A = SuperGlue(d, X) # affinity matrix

# Geometric model fitting
C = Sinkhorn(A) # soft correspondences
R_best, t_best, score_best = None, None, 0
for i in range(N): # N iterations of RANSAC
  R_i, t_i = sample_pose(C, x, X) # sample a pose hypothesis
  score_i = compute_score(R_i, t_i, C, x, X) # compute the score using soft inliers
  if score_i > score_best: # update the best pose hypothesis
    R_best, t_best, score_best = R_i, t_i, score_i

# PnP solver
R, t = EPnP(R_best, t_best, C, x, X) # refine the pose using nonlinear optimization

  score_i = compute_score(R_i, t_i, C, x, X) # compute the score using soft inliers and soft residuals
  if score_i > score_best: # update the best pose hypothesis
    R_best, t_best, score_best = R_i, t_i, score_i

# PnP solver
