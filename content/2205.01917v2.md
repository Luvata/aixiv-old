Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents CoCa, a contrastive captioner that pretrains an image-text encoder-decoder model with both contrastive loss and captioning loss on web-scale data.
- **Why**: The paper aims to explore large-scale pretrained foundation models for vision and vision-language tasks that can be quickly transferred to many downstream tasks with minimal adaptation.
- **How**: The paper uses a novel design that omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and applies contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs. The paper also treats all labels as text, unifying natural language supervision for representation learning. The paper evaluates CoCa on a broad range of downstream tasks and shows state-of-the-art performance.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- **A novel design of image-text encoder-decoder model** that omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations[^1^][1].
- **A joint training objective** that combines contrastive loss and captioning loss, sharing the same computational graph for efficiency[^1^][1].
- **A unified natural language supervision** that treats all labels as text, regardless of their source or modality[^1^][1].
- **A comprehensive evaluation** of CoCa on a broad range of downstream tasks, showing state-of-the-art performance with zero-shot transfer or minimal task-specific adaptation[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes CoCa, a contrastive captioner that pretrains an image-text encoder-decoder model with both contrastive loss and captioning loss on web-scale data[^1^][1].
- The paper uses a standard transformer architecture for the encoder-decoder model, with a few modifications[^1^][1]:
    * The encoder takes an image as input and produces a sequence of image embeddings[^1^][1].
    * The decoder takes a text as input and produces a sequence of text embeddings[^1^][1].
    * The decoder is divided into two parts: the first half does not have cross-attention to the encoder outputs, and the second half does[^1^][1].
    * The paper calls the first half of the decoder as theunimodal text encoderand the second half as themultimodal image-text decoder[^1^][1].
- The paper applies two losses during pretraining[^1^][1]:
    * A contrastive loss between the unimodal image embeddings from the encoder and the unimodal text embeddings from the decoder[^1^][1].
    * A captioning loss that predicts the next text token given the previous tokens and the image embeddings using the multimodal decoder[^1^][1].
- The paper pretrains CoCa on two types of data sources[^1^][1]:
    * Web-scale alt-text data, which consists of images and their associated text from web pages[^1^][1].
    * Annotated images, which consist of images and their labels from various datasets such as ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc[^1^][1].
- The paper treats all labels as text, regardless of their source or modality, and uses a special token to separate them from the natural language text[^1^][1].

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the encoder-decoder model
encoder = TransformerEncoder(image_size, num_layers, num_heads, hidden_size)
decoder = TransformerDecoder(vocab_size, num_layers, num_heads, hidden_size)

# Split the decoder into two parts
unimodal_text_encoder = decoder[:num_layers//2]
multimodal_image_text_decoder = decoder[num_layers//2:]

# Define the contrastive loss and the captioning loss
contrastive_loss = NTXentLoss(temperature)
captioning_loss = CrossEntropyLoss()

# Pretrain the model on web-scale alt-text data and annotated images
for batch in data_loader:
  # Get the images and texts from the batch
  images, texts = batch

  # Encode the images with the encoder
  image_embeddings = encoder(images)

  # Encode the texts with the unimodal text encoder

  # Compute the contrastive loss between image and text embeddings
  loss_contrastive = contrastive_loss(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)

  # Decode the texts with the multimodal image-text decoder
  text_logits = multimodal_image_text_decoder(texts, image_embeddings)

  # Compute the captioning loss between text logits and targets
  loss_captioning = captioning_loss(text_logits, texts[:, 1:])

  # Compute the total loss as a weighted sum of contrastive and captioning losses
  loss_total = alpha * loss_contrastive + beta * loss_captioning

  # Update the model parameters with gradient descent
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss_total.backward()
