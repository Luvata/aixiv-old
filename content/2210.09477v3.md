Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper presents UniTune, a method for general text-driven image editing that fine-tunes a large text-to-image diffusion model on a single image.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide an intuitive and flexible interface for art-direction that does not require additional inputs like masks or sketches, and that can handle diverse and complex edits while preserving the input image quality and semantics.
- **How**: The paper leverages the observation that with the right choice of parameters, a text-to-image diffusion model can be fine-tuned on a single image to perform the desired edit. The paper uses Imagen as the text-to-image model, but expects the method to work with other large-scale models as well. The paper evaluates the method on various use cases and demonstrates its wide applicability.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper at , the contributions are:

- A simple and novel method for text-driven image editing that fine-tunes a large text-to-image diffusion model on a single image
- A demonstration of the effectiveness and expressiveness of the method on various use cases, such as changing colors, adding or removing objects, changing styles, and more
- A comparison of the method with existing text-to-image and image-to-image models, showing that the method can handle more diverse and complex edits while maintaining high fidelity to the input image

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The method takes an arbitrary image and a textual edit description as input, and outputs an edited image that reflects the edit while preserving the input image quality and semantics
- The method fine-tunes a large text-to-image diffusion model on a single image, using a combination of reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, and style loss to encourage fidelity to the input image
- The method uses Imagen as the text-to-image model, which is a diffusion model that generates images by reversing a stochastic diffusion process conditioned on text
- The method modifies the diffusion model by adding an encoder network that encodes the input image into a latent vector, and using it as an additional input to the model
- The method also modifies the diffusion model by using a different noise schedule and learning rate schedule for fine-tuning on a single image
- The method allows the user to control the trade-off between fidelity and expressiveness by adjusting a parameter called edit strength


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper at :

```python
# Input: an image x and a textual edit description t
# Output: an edited image y that reflects the edit

# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model M
# Add an encoder network E to encode x into a latent vector z
# Fine-tune M and E on x using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, and style losses
# Set the edit strength parameter s to control the trade-off between fidelity and expressiveness
# Generate y by reversing the diffusion process conditioned on t, z, and s
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement the paper at :

```python
# Input: an image x and a textual edit description t
# Output: an edited image y that reflects the edit

# Load a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model M
# M consists of a text encoder T, an image encoder Q, and an image decoder P
# M generates images by reversing a stochastic diffusion process conditioned on text
# The diffusion process is defined by a noise schedule beta and a number of steps N

# Add an encoder network E to encode x into a latent vector z
# E has the same architecture as Q but with different parameters
# E takes x as input and outputs z of size D

# Fine-tune M and E on x using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, and style losses
# Define the reconstruction loss as the mean squared error between x and y
# Define the perceptual loss as the L2 distance between the VGG features of x and y
# Define the style loss as the L2 distance between the Gram matrices of the VGG features of x and y
# Define the total loss as a weighted sum of the reconstruction, perceptual, and style losses
# Use a different noise schedule alpha and a different learning rate schedule gamma for fine-tuning
# Use gradient descent to update the parameters of M and E by minimizing the total loss

# Set the edit strength parameter s to control the trade-off between fidelity and expressiveness
# s is a scalar value between 0 and 1 that scales the text embedding from T
# A higher s means more emphasis on the edit, while a lower s means more emphasis on the input image

# Generate y by reversing the diffusion process conditioned on t, z, and s
# Encode t into a text embedding u of size D using T
# Scale u by s to get v = s * u
# Initialize y_0 as a Gaussian noise image with mean x and variance beta_0
# For i from 1 to N:
  # Compute y_i as y_i-1 + sqrt(beta_i) * epsilon_i, where epsilon_i is Gaussian noise
  # Compute q_i as Q(y_i), where Q is the image encoder of M
  # Compute p_i as P(q_i + v, z), where P is the image decoder of M
  # Compute y_bar_i as (y_i - beta_i * p_i) / (1 - beta_i), where beta_i is the noise schedule of M
  # Set y_i as y_bar_i
# Return y_N as y
