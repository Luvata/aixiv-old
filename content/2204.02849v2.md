Here is a summary of the paper:

**What**: The paper proposes a method for image generation based on large-scale retrieval of similar images using k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) search. The method uses a diffusion-based model that trains on images only, without any paired text data, and leverages a joint text-image multi-modal metric.

**Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text-to-image models that require large-scale datasets of text-image pairs and are sensitive to the quality of the input text and the training dataset. The paper also aims to enable novel capabilities such as generating out-of-distribution images, performing text-driven local semantic manipulations, and fine-tuning trained models to new samples by simply adding them to the retrieval database.

**How**: The paper uses a diffusion-based model that learns to generate images by reversing a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the image until reaching a uniform distribution. The model uses a kNN search over a large-scale database of images to retrieve similar images at each noise level and uses them as additional conditioning for the diffusion process. The model also uses a multi-modal metric that measures the similarity between text and images based on their embeddings from pre-trained models. The paper evaluates the method on several datasets and compares it with baseline methods using human studies and automatic metrics.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- A method for image generation based on large-scale retrieval of similar images using kNN search and diffusion models.
- A demonstration of the robustness and versatility of the method on different datasets and domains, including natural images and stickers.
- A comparison of the method with existing text-to-image models that train on images only or on text-image pairs, showing superior results in terms of quality, diversity, and semantic alignment.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

The method section of the paper consists of three subsections: **Diffusion Models**, **kNN Search**, and **Multi-Modal Metric**.

- **Diffusion Models**: The paper reviews the basics of diffusion models, which are generative models that learn to reverse a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to an image until reaching a uniform distribution. The paper uses two diffusion models as backbones: DDIM and U-Net. The paper also introduces a text conditioning mechanism that allows the diffusion model to generate images conditioned on text inputs.

- **kNN Search**: The paper describes how to use kNN search over a large-scale database of images to retrieve similar images at each noise level of the diffusion process. The paper uses FAISS as an efficient kNN search library and shows how to use it in parallel with multiple GPUs. The paper also explains how to use the retrieved images as additional conditioning for the diffusion model.

- **Multi-Modal Metric**: The paper presents a multi-modal metric that measures the similarity between text and images based on their embeddings from pre-trained models. The paper uses CLIP as a text-image encoder and shows how to use it to compute the kNN search query and to filter out irrelevant images. The paper also shows how to use the multi-modal metric to perform text-driven local semantic manipulations on the generated images.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define a diffusion model with text conditioning
model = DiffusionModel(text_conditioning=True)

# Load a large-scale database of images
database = load_images()

# Load a pre-trained text-image encoder
encoder = CLIP()

# Define a text input
text = "a cute dog wearing a hat"

# Encode the text input
text_embedding = encoder.encode_text(text)

# Initialize an image with uniform noise
image = torch.rand(3, 256, 256)

# Loop over the noise levels from high to low
for t in reversed(range(model.num_timesteps)):

  # Compute the current noise level
  noise_level = model.get_noise_level(t)

  # Add noise to the image
  noisy_image = image + torch.randn_like(image) * noise_level

  # Retrieve k nearest images from the database using FAISS
  nearest_images = faiss_search(noisy_image, text_embedding, database, k=10)

  # Filter out irrelevant images using the multi-modal metric
  relevant_images = filter_images(noisy_image, text_embedding, nearest_images, encoder)

  # Predict the next image using the diffusion model conditioned on the text and the relevant images
  image = model.predict(noisy_image, text, relevant_images, t)

# Return the final image
return image
```
