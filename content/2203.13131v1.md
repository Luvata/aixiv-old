Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel text-to-image generation method that uses a scene sketch as an additional input to control the image layout and structure. The method also introduces domain-specific tokenization for faces and salient objects, and classifier-free guidance for the transformer model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing text-to-image methods, such as lack of controllability, low fidelity, and poor text relevancy. The paper also demonstrates several new capabilities enabled by the scene-based approach, such as scene editing, text editing with anchor scenes, out-of-distribution text handling, and story illustration generation.
- **How**: The paper builds on the DALL-E framework [^1^][1] and extends it with three main components: (i) a scene encoder that converts a scene sketch into a latent representation, (ii) a domain-specific tokenizer that uses face and object detectors to extract tokens from key image regions, and (iii) a classifier-free guidance module that uses self-attention masks to align the text, scene, and image tokens. The paper evaluates the method on the COCO dataset [^2^][2] and compares it with several baselines using FID scores and human judgments. The paper also showcases qualitative examples of the method's outputs and capabilities.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel text-to-image generation method that leverages a scene sketch as an additional input to control the image layout and structure.
- A domain-specific tokenization scheme that uses face and object detectors to extract tokens from key image regions, improving the fidelity and text relevancy of the generated images.
- A classifier-free guidance module that uses self-attention masks to align the text, scene, and image tokens, simplifying the training process and reducing the model size.
- State-of-the-art results on the COCO dataset in terms of FID scores and human evaluations, as well as several new capabilities enabled by the scene-based approach.


## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section:

- The method consists of three main components: a scene encoder, a domain-specific tokenizer, and a classifier-free guidance module.
- The scene encoder takes a scene sketch as input and encodes it into a latent representation using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The scene sketch is a simple drawing that indicates the location and shape of the objects and background in the image. The scene encoder can also generate a scene sketch from text using a transformer model trained on text-scene pairs.
- The domain-specific tokenizer takes an image as input and uses face and object detectors to extract tokens from key image regions, such as faces and salient objects. The tokens are then embedded into a latent space using learned embeddings. The tokenizer also uses a standard VQ-VAE  to encode the rest of the image into tokens. The tokenizer can also decode an image from tokens using a CNN decoder.
- The classifier-free guidance module takes text, scene, and image tokens as input and aligns them using self-attention masks. The masks are computed based on the similarity between the text and scene tokens, and the scene and image tokens. The module then uses a transformer model to generate image tokens conditioned on the text and scene tokens. The module does not use any classifier or softmax layer to predict the image tokens, but instead uses nearest neighbor search in the token embedding space.
