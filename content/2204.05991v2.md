Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents ReCLIP, a zero-shot baseline for referring expression comprehension (ReC), which is the task of localizing an object in an image given a textual description.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the domain shift problem in ReC, which means that supervised models trained on one visual domain may not perform well on another domain. The paper also wants to leverage the power of large-scale pre-trained models like CLIP for ReC without fine-tuning or additional data.
- **How**: The paper proposes two components for ReCLIP: a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP; and a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial relations. The paper evaluates ReCLIP on two datasets: RefCOCOg and RefGTA, and shows that it outperforms previous zero-shot baselines and reduces the gap with supervised models.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- **ReCLIP**, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline for ReC that repurposes CLIP, a state-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC.
- A **region-scoring method** that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP.
- A **spatial relation resolver** that handles several types of spatial relations.
- A **synthetic dataset** for evaluating spatial reasoning capabilities of ReC models.
- An **extensive evaluation** of ReCLIP on two datasets: RefCOCOg and RefGTA, showing that it outperforms previous zero-shot baselines and reduces the gap with supervised models.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the two components of ReCLIP: region-scoring and spatial relation resolver.
- The **region-scoring method** takes an image and a referring expression as input, and generates a set of object proposals using an off-the-shelf detector. For each proposal, it crops out the region and blurs the rest of the image, and passes it to CLIP along with the referring expression. It computes the similarity score between the image and text embeddings from CLIP, and selects the proposal with the highest score as the output.
- The **spatial relation resolver** is a module that handles spatial relations such as left, right, above, below, etc. It takes an image, a referring expression, and a set of proposals as input, and parses the expression to identify the spatial relation and the target object. It then filters out the proposals that do not satisfy the spatial relation with respect to the target object, and passes the remaining proposals to the region-scoring method. It returns the proposal with the highest score as the output.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: an image I and a referring expression E
# Output: a bounding box B that localizes the object in I referred by E

# Generate a set of object proposals P using an off-the-shelf detector
P = detect_objects(I)

# Parse the expression E to identify the spatial relation R and the target object T
R, T = parse_expression(E)

# Filter out the proposals that do not satisfy R with respect to T
P = filter_proposals(P, R, T)

# For each proposal p in P, crop out the region and blur the rest of the image
C = [crop_and_blur(I, p) for p in P]

# Pass each cropped image c and the expression E to CLIP and compute the similarity score
S = [clip(c, E) for c in C]

# Select the proposal with the highest score as the output
B = P[argmax(S)]

# Return the output
return B
```
