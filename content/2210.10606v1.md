Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper studies how DALLE-2, a text-to-image model, maps words in the prompt to concepts in the generated image.

Why: The paper aims to highlight the differences between DALLE-2 and human language processing, and to expose some flaws in the word-to-concept mapping of DALLE-2.

How: The paper collects a set of stimuli that show that DALLE-2 does not respect the constraint that each word has a single role in the interpretation, and sometimes re-uses the same word for different purposes. The paper also analyzes the possible causes and implications of these phenomena.

Here is a list of the contributions of the paper:

```
- The paper introduces a new phenomenon of word-to-concept mapping in text-to-image models, namely, the violation of the single-role principle.
- The paper provides a set of stimuli that demonstrate this phenomenon in DALLE-2, such as nouns with multiple senses, modifiers with multiple targets, and words with dual roles.
- The paper analyzes the possible causes and implications of this phenomenon, such as the lack of resource sensitivity, the influence of word order and frequency, and the implications for model evaluation and interpretability.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The paper uses DALLE-2, a diffusion-based text-to-image model, as the main subject of study. The paper constructs a set of stimuli that are designed to test the word-to-concept mapping of DALLE-2 in various scenarios, such as nouns with multiple senses, modifiers with multiple targets, and words with dual roles. The paper generates images for each stimulus using DALLE-2 and analyzes the results qualitatively and quantitatively. The paper also compares DALLE-2 with human language processing and discusses the possible causes and implications of the observed phenomena.
