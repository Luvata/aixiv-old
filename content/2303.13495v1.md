## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new task, Relation Inversion, which aims to learn a specific relation (represented as "relation prompt") from exemplar images and apply it to generate new images with different objects, backgrounds, and styles. The paper also introduces a novel framework, ReVersion, which leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and a preposition prior to learn relation prompts in a contrastive and disentangled way. The paper also contributes a new benchmark, ReVersion Benchmark, which provides various exemplar images with diverse relations for evaluation.
- **Why**: The paper addresses the limitation of existing inversion methods for diffusion models, which mainly focus on capturing object appearances and ignore object relations, another important pillar in the visual world. The paper argues that learning relation prompts from exemplar images can enable more flexible and creative image generation tasks.
- **How**: The paper learns relation prompts from a frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model by optimizing a relation-steering contrastive loss, which encourages the relation prompt to capture the interaction between objects and be disentangled from object appearances. The paper also imposes a preposition prior on the relation prompt, which assumes that real-world relation prompts can be sparsely activated upon a set of basis prepositional words. The paper further devises relation-focal importance sampling to emphasize high-level interactions over low-level appearances during diffusion sampling. The paper evaluates the proposed method on the ReVersion Benchmark and compares it with existing methods across a wide range of visual relations.
