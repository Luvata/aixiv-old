Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a method to generate personalized 3D models from text and a few images of a subject.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing text-to-3D methods that either lack personalization or require expensive 3D scans of the subject.
- **How**: The paper combines two recent techniques: DreamBooth, which personalizes text-to-image models from a few images of a subject, and DreamFusion, which generates 3D models from text. The paper proposes a 3-stage optimization strategy to jointly leverage the 3D consistency of neural radiance fields and the personalization capability of text-to-image models. The paper demonstrates that the method can produce high-quality, subject-specific 3D models with text-driven modifications such as novel poses, colors and attributes.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel approach to personalize text-to-3D generative models from as few as 3-6 casually captured images of a subject.
- A 3-stage optimization strategy that jointly leverages the 3D consistency of neural radiance fields and the personalization capability of text-to-image models.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies that show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
- A large-scale dataset of 3D models and text descriptions for text-to-3D generation.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper describes the proposed approach to personalize text-to-3D generative models. The approach consists of three main components:

- **Personalized Text-to-Image Model**: This component uses a few images of a subject to fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image model, such as CLIP+DALL-E. The fine-tuned model can generate subject-specific images from text descriptions.
- **Text-to-3D Model**: This component uses a pre-trained text-to-3D model, such as DreamFusion, to generate a 3D neural radiance field (NeRF) from a text description. The NeRF can render novel views of the 3D model from any camera pose.
- **Joint Optimization**: This component optimizes the personalized text-to-image model and the text-to-3D model jointly to ensure 3D consistency and personalization. The optimization consists of three stages: (1) optimizing the NeRF using the images generated by the text-to-image model, (2) optimizing the text-to-image model using the images rendered by the NeRF, and (3) optimizing both models simultaneously using a cycle-consistency loss. The joint optimization produces a personalized NeRF that can be rendered from any viewpoint.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: text description T, images of subject I

# Fine-tune M1 on I to get personalized text-to-image model M1'
# Generate images G from T using M1'

# Initialize NeRF N from T using M2

# Optimize M1' using R to get personalized text-to-image model M1''

# Generate images G' from T using M1''
# Optimize N1 using G' to get NeRF N2

# Render images R' from N2 using random camera poses
# Optimize M1'' and N2 jointly using R' and G' with cycle-consistency loss to get personalized text-to-image model M1''' and personalized NeRF N3
