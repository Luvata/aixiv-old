## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called CLIP4IDC to transfer a CLIP model for the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task, which aims at generating sentences to describe differences between two similar-looking images[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper addresses two major issues of conventional approaches to IDC: (1) a large domain gap between the pre-training datasets used for training the visual feature extractor and that of the downstream IDC task, and (2) the visual feature extractor, when separately encoding two images, often does not effectively encode the visual changes between two images[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper introduces an adaptation training process to adapt CLIP's visual encoder to capture and align differences in image pairs based on the textual descriptions. The paper also fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder and decoder to generate captions for IDC[^1^][1]. The paper evaluates CLIP4IDC on three IDC benchmark datasets, CLEVR-Change, Spot-the-Diff, and Image-Editing-Request, and shows that it outperforms existing methods[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the contributions are:

- Applying the CLIP model to the IDC task on raw pixels, which enables the learning to be propagated back to the feature extractor[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- Introducing an adaptation training process to adapt CLIP's visual encoder to capture and align differences in image pairs based on the textual descriptions[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- Fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder and decoder to generate captions for IDC[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- Outperforming existing methods on three IDC benchmark datasets, CLEVR-Change, Spot-the-Diff, and Image-Editing-Request[^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][3].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper adopts the CLIP model [^1^][1] as the backbone for IDC, which consists of a vision encoder, a text encoder and a text decoder[^1^][1].
- The paper proposes a two-stage training process for CLIP4IDC: adaptation and fine-tuning[^1^][1].
- In the adaptation stage, the paper adapts CLIP's vision encoder to capture and align differences in image pairs based on the textual descriptions. The paper uses a contrastive learning objective to maximize the similarity between the visual features of an image pair and the corresponding caption, while minimizing the similarity with other captions[^1^][1].
- In the fine-tuning stage, the paper fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder and decoder to generate captions for IDC. The paper uses a cross-entropy loss to optimize the captioning network[^1^][1].
- The paper also introduces some data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness and generalization of CLIP4IDC, such as random cropping, color jittering, Gaussian noise and random erasing[^1^][1].
