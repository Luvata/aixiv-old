## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for compositional visual generation using diffusion models, which are a type of generative model that can produce realistic images from noise by reversing a diffusion process.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing text-guided diffusion models, such as DALLE-2, which can generate impressive images from natural language descriptions, but often fail to capture the compositionality of certain concepts, such as the attributes and relations of different objects in a scene.
- **How**: The paper introduces a novel way of interpreting diffusion models as energy-based models, which allows them to be composed by combining their energy functions. The paper also presents a framework for learning and composing diffusion models for different components of an image, such as objects, attributes, relations, and backgrounds. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method can generate complex scenes that are more faithful to the input descriptions than DALLE-2, and can also generalize to new combinations that are rarely seen in the real world.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper first introduces the **background and notation** of diffusion models, which are a type of generative model that can produce realistic images from noise by reversing a diffusion process. The paper also reviews the **text-guided diffusion models**, such as DALLE-2, which can condition the image generation on natural language descriptions using an encoder-decoder architecture.
- The paper then presents the main idea of **interpreting diffusion models as energy-based models**, which are another type of generative model that define the data distribution using an energy function. The paper shows that the energy function of a diffusion model can be derived from its score function, which measures the gradient of the log-density with respect to the data. The paper also shows that the energy functions of different diffusion models can be **composed** by adding them together, resulting in a new diffusion model that can generate images that satisfy multiple constraints.
- The paper then describes the **framework for learning and composing diffusion models for different components of an image**, such as objects, attributes, relations, and backgrounds. The paper proposes a hierarchical structure that organizes the components into different levels, and a compositional loss function that encourages the learned diffusion models to be consistent with each other and with the input descriptions. The paper also introduces a **compositional inference algorithm** that can sample images from the composed diffusion model using annealed Langevin dynamics.
- The paper finally explains how to **compose pre-trained text-guided diffusion models** using the proposed method, and how to **generate photorealistic images** from natural language descriptions using the composed diffusion model. The paper also discusses some **limitations and future directions** of the proposed method, such as handling occlusions, improving scalability, and incorporating more structure and semantics.

# Define the diffusion model class
class DiffusionModel:
  def __init__(self, score_function):
    # Initialize the score function that measures the gradient of the log-density
    self.score_function = score_function
  
  def sample(self, noise_level, num_steps):
    # Sample an image from the diffusion model using reverse diffusion
    # noise_level: the initial noise level

    # Initialize a random image with the given noise level
    image = torch.randn(3, 256, 256) * noise_level
    # Loop over the diffusion steps in reverse order
    for step in reversed(range(num_steps)):
      # Compute the current noise level and variance
      noise_level = get_noise_level(step, num_steps)
      variance = get_variance(noise_level)
      # Compute the score function at the current image
      score = self.score_function(image)
      # Update the image using Langevin dynamics
      image = image + variance * score + torch.randn_like(image) * math.sqrt(variance)
    # Return the final image
    return image

# Define the energy-based model class
class EnergyBasedModel:
  def __init__(self, energy_function):
    # Initialize the energy function that defines the data distribution
    self.energy_function = energy_function
  
  def sample(self, num_steps, step_size):
    # Sample an image from the energy-based model using annealed Langevin dynamics
    # num_steps: the number of Langevin steps
    # step_size: the step size for Langevin updates
    # Initialize a random image
    image = torch.randn(3, 256, 256)
    # Loop over the Langevin steps
    for step in range(num_steps):
      # Compute the current temperature and variance
      temperature = get_temperature(step, num_steps)
      variance = get_variance(temperature)
      # Compute the energy function and its gradient at the current image
      energy = self.energy_function(image)
      gradient = torch.autograd.grad(energy, image)[0]
      # Update the image using Langevin dynamics
      image = image - step_size * gradient + torch.randn_like(image) * math.sqrt(variance)
    # Return the final image
    return image

# Define the function to compose diffusion models as energy-based models
def compose_diffusion_models(diffusion_models):
  # Compose a list of diffusion models by adding their energy functions
  # diffusion_models: a list of diffusion models to be composed
  # Initialize an empty list of energy functions
  energy_functions = []
  # Loop over the diffusion models
  for diffusion_model in diffusion_models:
    # Get the score function of the diffusion model
    score_function = diffusion_model.score_function
    # Define a function to compute the energy function from the score function using integration by parts
    def energy_function(image):
      return -torch.sum(image * score_function(image)) + torch.sum(torch.log(1 + torch.exp(score_function(image))))
    # Append the energy function to the list
    energy_functions.append(energy_function)
  # Define a function to compute the composed energy function by adding the individual energy functions
  def composed_energy_function(image):
    return sum(energy_function(image) for energy_function in energy_functions)
  # Return a new energy-based model with the composed energy function
  return EnergyBasedModel(composed_energy_function)

# Define a framework for learning and composing diffusion models for different components of an image

# Define a hierarchical structure that organizes the components into different levels

# Level 0: Backgrounds (e.g., sky, grass, water)
# Level 1: Objects (e.g., car, house, tree)
# Level 2: Attributes (e.g., color, shape, size)
# Level 3: Relations (e.g., above, below, next to)

# Define a compositional loss function that encourages the learned diffusion models to be consistent with each other and with the input descriptions

# For each level, learn a set of diffusion models for different components using a standard reconstruction loss

# For each pair of levels, learn a set of compositional operators that can combine two components from different levels using a compositional loss

# The compositional loss consists of two terms:

# - A consistency term that measures how well the composed image matches the input description using a pretrained text-guided diffusion model (e.g., DALLE-2)
# - A diversity term that measures how diverse are the composed images using an entropy-based regularization

# Define a compositional inference algorithm that can sample images from the composed diffusion model using annealed Langevin dynamics

# Given an input description, parse it into a list of components and their levels

# Initialize an empty list of diffusion models to be composed

# Loop over the levels from high to low:

# - For each component in the current level, find the corresponding diffusion model and append it to the list
# - For each pair of components in the current level and the lower level, find the corresponding compositional operator and apply it to the diffusion models of the two components
# - Remove the diffusion models of the lower level components from the list

# Compose the remaining diffusion models in the list using the compose_diffusion_models function

# Sample an image from the composed diffusion model using the sample method of the energy-based model class

# Return the sampled image
