Here is a summary of the paper in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents a methodology to automatically discover failure cases of image classifiers using off-the-shelf image generation and captioning models[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the open challenge of finding bugs in vision models under real-world settings, without prior assumptions on the types of failures and how they arise[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper leverages a conditional text-to-image generative model to generate synthetic, yet realistic, inputs given a ground-truth label. Misclassified inputs are clustered and a captioning model is used to describe each cluster. Each cluster's description is used in turn to generate more inputs and assess whether specific clusters induce more failures than expected[^1^][1]. The paper demonstrates that this approach can effectively interrogate classifiers trained on ImageNet to find specific failure cases and discover spurious correlations. The paper also shows that the approach can scale to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures[^1^][1]. The paper also describes some limitations and pitfalls related to this approach[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the contributions are:

- The paper describes a methodology to discover failures of image classifiers trained on ImageNet using off-the-shelf generative models, without collecting new datasets or relying on manually crafted synthetic images[^2^][2].
- The paper demonstrates how the methodology can effectively interrogate classifiers to find specific failure cases and discover spurious correlations[^1^][1].
- The paper shows how the methodology can scale to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures[^1^][1].
- The paper serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the utility of large-scale generative models to automatically discover bugs in vision models in an open-ended manner[^1^][1] [^3^][4].
- The paper also describes some limitations and pitfalls related to this approach[^1^][1] [^3^][4].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper details a pipeline that consists of four steps: generation, classification, clustering, and captioning[^1^][1].
- In the generation step, the paper uses a conditional text-to-image generative model to produce synthetic images given a ground-truth label[^1^][1]. The paper uses DALL·E2 as an example of such a model[^1^][1].
- In the classification step, the paper uses an image classifier to predict the label for each generated image and identify the misclassified ones[^1^][1]. The paper uses ResNet-50 as an example of such a classifier[^1^][1].
- In the clustering step, the paper uses a feature extractor to embed the misclassified images into a feature space and cluster them using k-means algorithm[^1^][1]. The paper uses CLIP as an example of such a feature extractor[^1^][1].
- In the captioning step, the paper uses a captioning model to generate a textual description for each cluster of misclassified images[^1^][1]. The paper uses FLAMINGO as an example of such a captioning model[^1^][1].
- The paper also describes how to use the cluster descriptions to generate more inputs and assess whether specific clusters induce more failures than expected[^1^][1]. The paper also shows how to use the pipeline to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures[^1^][1].
