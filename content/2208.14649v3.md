Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes an efficient framework that can produce a single feature representation for a high-resolution image that injects image details and shares the same semantic space as the original CLIP model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitation of the CLIP-like visual language models that lose subtle details in the feature representation when inputting high-resolution images due to the fixed image input size (e.g., 224).
- **How**: The paper trains a feature fusing model based on CLIP features extracted from a carefully designed image patch method that can cover objects of any scale, weakly supervised by image-agnostic class prompted queries. The paper also constructs a CLEVR-like synthetic dataset called CLVER-DS to demonstrate the detail retrieval ability of the framework.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel framework that can inject image details into CLIP's feature space and produce a single feature representation for a high-resolution image that is semantically consistent with the original CLIP model.
- A new image patch method that can cover objects of any scale and preserve the spatial information of the image.
- A new synthetic dataset called CLVER-DS that is fully annotated and has a controllable object scale, which can be used to evaluate the detail retrieval ability of visual language models.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces a **feature fusing model** that takes multiple CLIP features extracted from different image patches as input and outputs a single feature vector that injects image details and shares the same semantic space as the original CLIP model.
- The paper proposes a **complete cover** image patch method that divides a high-resolution image into multiple overlapping patches with different sizes and positions, ensuring that objects of any scale can be covered by at least one patch.
- The paper uses **image-agnostic class prompted queries** as weak supervision to train the feature fusing model, which are text queries that do not depend on specific image content but only on general image classes (e.g., "a photo of an animal").
- The paper constructs a **CLEVR-like synthetic dataset** called CLVER-DS that has a controllable object scale and can be used to evaluate the detail retrieval ability of the framework. The dataset consists of images with different numbers and sizes of 3D objects and corresponding text queries.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the feature fusing model as a neural network with two linear layers
def feature_fusing_model(features):
  # Concatenate the features along the last dimension
  features = torch.cat(features, dim=-1)
  # Apply the first linear layer with ReLU activation
  hidden = torch.relu(self.linear1(features))
  # Apply the second linear layer with L2 normalization
  output = torch.nn.functional.normalize(self.linear2(hidden), dim=-1)
  return output

# Define the complete cover image patch method as a function that returns a list of patches
def complete_cover(image):
  # Initialize an empty list of patches
  patches = []
  # Define the patch sizes and strides as fractions of the image size
  patch_sizes = [0.25, 0.5, 1.0]
  patch_strides = [0.125, 0.25, 0.5]
  # Loop over the patch sizes and strides
  for size, stride in zip(patch_sizes, patch_strides):
    # Compute the number of patches along each dimension
    num_x = math.ceil(1 / stride)
    num_y = math.ceil(1 / stride)
    # Loop over the patch positions
    for i in range(num_x):
      for j in range(num_y):
        # Compute the patch coordinates as fractions of the image size
        x1 = i * stride
        y1 = j * stride
        x2 = x1 + size
        y2 = y1 + size
        # Crop the image according to the patch coordinates
        patch = image.crop(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        # Resize the patch to a fixed size (e.g., 224)
        patch = patch.resize(224, 224)
        # Append the patch to the list of patches
        patches.append(patch)
  return patches

  "a photo of an animal",
  "a photo of a plant",
  "a photo of a person",
  "a photo of a vehicle",
  "a photo of a building",
  ...

      for image in images:
        # Apply the complete cover image patch method to get a list of patches
        patches = complete_cover(image)
        # Loop over the patches in the list
        for patch in patches:
          # Apply the CLIP model to get a feature vector for each patch
          feature = CLIP_model(patch)
          # Append the feature vector to the list of features
          features.append(feature)
      # Apply the feature fusing model to get a single feature vector for each image
      fused_features = feature_fusing_model(features)
      # Compute the cosine similarity between each fused feature and each class prompted query
      similarities = cosine_similarity(fused_features, class_prompted_queries)
      # Compute the cross-entropy loss between the similarities and the labels
      loss = cross_entropy_loss(similarities, labels)
      # Update the parameters of the feature fusing model using backpropagation and gradient descent
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()
```
