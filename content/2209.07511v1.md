Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called **test-time prompt tuning (TPT)** that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample for pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) [^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the zero-shot generalization of vision-language models to unseen domains and tasks without requiring additional task-specific training data or hand-engineered prompts [^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. The paper evaluates TPT on natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories and shows that it outperforms or matches previous prompt tuning approaches that use additional training data [^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper [^1^][1]:

- **Overview**: The paper introduces the test-time prompt tuning (TPT) framework that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample for pre-trained vision-language models. TPT consists of two steps: prompt initialization and prompt optimization. Prompt initialization generates a set of candidate prompts based on the test sample and a pre-defined template. Prompt optimization selects the best prompt among the candidates by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection over different augmented views of the test sample.
- **Prompt initialization**: The paper uses a template-based approach to generate candidate prompts based on the test sample. The template is a text pattern that contains one or more placeholders for category names. For example, a template could be "a photo of a {category}". The paper uses two types of templates: fixed templates and dynamic templates. Fixed templates are predefined and do not change with the test sample. Dynamic templates are generated by extracting noun phrases from the test sample using a part-of-speech tagger. The paper concatenates the fixed and dynamic templates to form a set of candidate prompts for each category.
- **Prompt optimization**: The paper uses an entropy minimization with confidence selection technique to optimize the prompt among the candidates. The idea is to find the prompt that makes the model have consistent predictions across different augmented views of the test sample. The paper first applies random cropping and color jittering to generate multiple views of the test sample. Then, for each candidate prompt, the paper computes the softmax output of the model for each view and averages them to obtain a mean prediction vector. The paper then selects the top-k elements of the mean prediction vector and computes their entropy as a measure of uncertainty. The paper chooses the prompt that has the lowest entropy among the candidates as the optimal prompt.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a test sample x, a set of categories C, a pre-trained vision-language model M, a set of fixed templates T_fixed, a number of views V, a number of top-k elements K
# Output: a prediction y for x

# Step 1: Prompt initialization
T_dynamic = extract_noun_phrases(x) # use a part-of-speech tagger to extract noun phrases from x
T = T_fixed + T_dynamic # concatenate fixed and dynamic templates
P = {} # initialize an empty dictionary to store candidate prompts
for c in C: # for each category
  P[c] = [] # initialize an empty list to store candidate prompts for c
  for t in T: # for each template
    p = t.replace("{category}", c) # replace the placeholder with the category name
    P[c].append(p) # append the prompt to the list

# Step 2: Prompt optimization
X = augment(x, V) # apply random cropping and color jittering to generate V views of x
E = {} # initialize an empty dictionary to store entropy values
for c in C: # for each category
  E[c] = {} # initialize an empty dictionary to store entropy values for c
  for p in P[c]: # for each candidate prompt for c
    S = [] # initialize an empty list to store softmax outputs
    for x' in X: # for each view of x
      s = M(x', p) # compute the softmax output of the model for x' and p
      S.append(s) # append the softmax output to the list
    m = mean(S) # compute the mean prediction vector over V views
    k = top_k(m, K) # select the top-k elements of the mean prediction vector
    e = entropy(k) # compute the entropy of the top-k elements
    E[c][p] = e # store the entropy value for c and p

y = None # initialize the prediction as None
e_min = inf # initialize the minimum entropy as infinity
for c in C: # for each category
  for p in P[c]: # for each candidate prompt for c
    e = E[c][p] # get the entropy value for c and p
    if e < e_min: # if the entropy is lower than the current minimum
      e_min = e # update the minimum entropy
      y = c # update the prediction

return y # return the prediction
