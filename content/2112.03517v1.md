Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes a novel model, called CG-NeRF, that can generate multi-view images reflecting extra input conditions such as images or texts.

Why: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing NeRF-based generative models that cannot generate images with user-specified characteristics.

How: The paper introduces a unified architecture that disentangles the shape and appearance from a condition given in various forms, and a pose-consistent diversity loss that ensures multimodal outputs with view consistency.

Here is a summary of the method section:

- The paper presents a unified architecture that consists of three modules: a condition encoder, a shape encoder, and an appearance encoder.
- The condition encoder takes an input condition in various forms (such as image or text) and encodes it into a latent vector that represents the common characteristics of the desired output.
- The shape encoder takes a 3D coordinate and a viewpoint as inputs and outputs a density value and a shape feature vector that represent the shape of the scene.
- The appearance encoder takes a noise code, a shape feature vector, and a condition latent vector as inputs and outputs an RGB color value and an appearance feature vector that represent the appearance of the scene.
- The paper also introduces a pose-consistent diversity loss that encourages the model to generate diverse outputs for different noise codes while maintaining view consistency for the same noise code.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
# Input: a condition x, a camera pose p, a noise code z
# Output: a multi-view image y

# Encode the condition x into a latent vector c
c = condition_encoder(x)

# Initialize an empty image y
y = []

# For each pixel location u in the image plane
for u in y:

  # Sample a 3D coordinate X along the ray r from the camera pose p
  X = sample_ray(r, p)

  # Encode the 3D coordinate X and the camera pose p into a density value sigma and a shape feature vector f_s
  sigma, f_s = shape_encoder(X, p)

  # Encode the noise code z, the shape feature vector f_s, and the condition latent vector c into a color value C and an appearance feature vector f_a
  C, f_a = appearance_encoder(z, f_s, c)

  # Compute the alpha value for the pixel location u using the density value sigma and the distance t along the ray r
  alpha = compute_alpha(sigma, t)

  # Compute the color value for the pixel location u using the alpha value and the color value C
  color = compute_color(alpha, C)

  # Assign the color value to the pixel location u in the image y
  y[u] = color

# Return the image y
