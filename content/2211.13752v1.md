## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to guide a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model with a spatial map from another domain (e.g., sketch) during inference time. The method does not require to train a dedicated model or a specialized encoder for the task. The paper focuses on the sketch-to-image translation task as an example of the method's application.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the lack of control handles that can guide spatial properties of the synthesized images from text-to-image models. The paper argues that such control handles can enable more expressive and robust image generation that follows the guidance of a sketch of arbitrary style or domain.
- **How**: The paper introduces a Latent Guidance Predictor (LGP) - a small, per-pixel, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that maps latent features of noisy images to spatial maps, where the deep features are extracted from the core Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) network. The LGP is trained only on a few thousand images and constitutes a differential guiding map predictor, over which the loss is computed and propagated back to push the intermediate images to agree with the spatial map. The per-pixel training offers flexibility and locality which allows the technique to perform well on out-of-domain sketches, including free-hand style drawings[^1^][1].

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A universal approach to guide a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model with a spatial map from another domain during inference time, without requiring to train a dedicated model or a specialized encoder for the task.
- A Latent Guidance Predictor (LGP) - a small, per-pixel, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that maps latent features of noisy images to spatial maps, where the deep features are extracted from the core Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) network.
- A demonstration of the method's effectiveness and robustness on the sketch-to-image translation task, showing that it can generate high-quality images that follow the guidance of a sketch of arbitrary style or domain. The paper also shows that the method can be applied to other domains such as edge maps and semantic maps.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper adopts the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the core text-to-image model, which is a generative model that learns to sample images from a simple Gaussian prior by reversing a Markov chain of noisy images. The paper uses a pretrained DDPM model that can generate images from text prompts.
- The paper introduces a Latent Guidance Predictor (LGP) - a small, per-pixel, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that maps latent features of noisy images to spatial maps, where the latent features are extracted from the DDPM network. The LGP is trained only on a few thousand images and constitutes a differential guiding map predictor, over which the loss is computed and propagated back to push the intermediate images to agree with the spatial map.
- The paper describes the training procedure of the LGP, which involves sampling noisy images from the DDPM model using text prompts and corresponding spatial maps (e.g., sketches) as inputs. The paper also describes how to apply the LGP during inference time, which involves feeding a text prompt and a spatial map to the DDPM model and using the LGP to guide the diffusion process towards the desired output image.
- The paper evaluates the method on the sketch-to-image translation task, using various datasets and sketch styles. The paper also shows that the method can be applied to other domains such as edge maps and semantic maps. The paper compares the method with existing text-to-image models and demonstrates its advantages in terms of quality, diversity, and controllability.
