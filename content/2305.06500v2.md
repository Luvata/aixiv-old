Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper is about **InstructBLIP**, a general-purpose vision-language model that can follow natural language instructions for various tasks[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of building general-purpose vision-language models that can generalize to diverse and unseen tasks, which are not well handled by existing methods such as multitask learning and vision-language pretraining[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- **How**: The paper proposes a systematic and comprehensive study on **vision-language instruction tuning** based on the pretrained BLIP-2 models[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. It also introduces an **instruction-aware Query Transformer** that extracts informative features tailored to the given instruction[^1^][1] [^2^][2]. The paper evaluates the InstructBLIP models on 26 publicly available datasets and demonstrates their state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and finetuned settings[^1^][1] [^2^][2].


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- They conduct the first systematic and comprehensive study on vision-language instruction tuning based on the pretrained BLIP-2 models .
- They introduce an instruction-aware Query Transformer that enables the model to extract informative features tailored to the given instruction .
- They achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across all 13 held-out datasets, substantially outperforming BLIP-2 and the larger Flamingo models .
- They also lead to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned on individual downstream tasks (e.g., 90.7% accuracy on ScienceQA questions with image contexts) .
- They qualitatively demonstrate the advantages of InstructBLIP over concurrent multimodal models .

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper adopts the **pre-training and instruction tuning pipeline** for vision-language models, which consists of two stages: **vision-language pre-training** and **vision-language instruction tuning**[^1^][2].
- For vision-language pre-training, the paper uses the **BLIP-2 models** as the base models, which are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with various objectives[^1^][2].
- For vision-language instruction tuning, the paper transforms 26 publicly available datasets into a unified format of **instruction, input and output**[^1^][2]. The paper also categorizes the datasets into two clusters: **held-in** and **held-out**, for training and evaluation respectively[^1^][2].
- The paper introduces an **instruction-aware Query Transformer** that modifies the standard Transformer encoder to extract informative features from both visual and textual inputs based on the given instruction[^1^][2]. The paper also proposes a **multi-modal fusion layer** that fuses the features from different modalities and feeds them to a standard Transformer decoder for output generation[^1^][2].
- The paper evaluates the InstructBLIP models on both zero-shot and finetuned settings, using various metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR[^1^][2]. The paper also conducts qualitative analysis and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods[^1^][2].
