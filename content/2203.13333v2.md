Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a technique for zero-shot generation of a 3D model using only a target text prompt. The technique relies on a pre-trained CLIP model that compares the input text prompt with differentiably rendered images of the 3D model. The technique can generate shape, texture or both for the 3D model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating 3D models from text without any 3D supervision or training of generative models. The paper also demonstrates the potential of using pretrained image-text models for 3D content creation and manipulation.
- **How**: The paper uses a limit subdivided surface as a control shape that can be deformed along with its texture map and normal map to obtain a 3D asset that corresponds to the input text prompt. The paper optimizes the mesh parameters directly using gradient descent on the CLIP loss function that measures the similarity between the text prompt and the rendered images of the 3D model. The paper introduces several techniques to constrain the optimization to produce plausible meshes and textures, such as image augmentations and a pretrained prior that generates CLIP image embeddings given a text embedding.

The summary is based on the abstract and introduction of the paper[^1^][1].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper uses a limit subdivided surface as a control shape that can be deformed along with its texture map and normal map to obtain a 3D asset that corresponds to the input text prompt. The paper uses a pre-trained CLIP model that compares the input text prompt with differentiably rendered images of the 3D model using a neural renderer. The paper optimizes the mesh parameters directly using gradient descent on the CLIP loss function that measures the similarity between the text prompt and the rendered images of the 3D model.
- The paper introduces several techniques to constrain the optimization to produce plausible meshes and textures, such as image augmentations, a pretrained prior, and a regularization term. The image augmentations include random cropping, flipping, rotation, scaling, color jittering, and blurring. The pretrained prior is a network that generates CLIP image embeddings given a text embedding, trained on a large dataset of image-text pairs. The regularization term penalizes large deviations from the initial control shape and encourages smoothness of the mesh.
- The paper also describes how to generate shape only, texture only, or both shape and texture using different variants of the method. The paper also discusses how to handle multiple text prompts and how to manipulate existing 3D models using text.

The summary is based on sections 3 and 4 of the paper[^1^][1].
