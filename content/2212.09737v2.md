Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm to enhance the visual grounding ability of cross-modal models trained with Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP).
- **Why**: The paper observes that VLP models often lack the visual grounding/localization capability which is critical for many downstream tasks such as visual reasoning.
- **How**: The paper divides the image into blocks, and identifies the objects in each block through an object detector. It then reformulates the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given object. The paper introduces PTP into several state-of-the-art VLP frameworks and shows significant improvements across various benchmarks.

According to the paper at [^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm** that improves the visual grounding capability of cross-modal models trained with Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP).
- **A simple yet effective fill-in-the-blank formulation** of the visual grounding task given a PTP that encourages the model to predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given object.
- **A comprehensive evaluation** of PTP on several state-of-the-art VLP frameworks and various downstream tasks, showing significant improvements across different benchmarks and model architectures.
- **A fast inference speed** of PTP that discards the object detector for inference while achieving comparable results with object-detector based methods.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces the **Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP)**, which is a text template that contains placeholders for the position and object information of an image block. For example, a PTP for an image of a dog and a cat could be "The block [P] has a [O]".
- The paper describes how to **generate PTPs** for an image by dividing it into N×N blocks and using an object detector to identify the objects in each block. The paper also explains how to handle occluded objects and multiple objects in a block.
- The paper presents two types of **visual grounding tasks** given a PTP: object prediction and position regression. In object prediction, the model is given a PTP with a position placeholder filled and asked to predict the object in that block. In position regression, the model is given a PTP with an object placeholder filled and asked to predict the block of that object.
- The paper details how to **train cross-modal models** with PTPs by using masked language modeling (MLM) and masked image modeling (MIM) objectives. The paper also shows how to **fine-tune** the models on downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval and image captioning.
- The paper discusses some **implementation details** such as the choice of N, the object detector, the tokenizer, and the optimization settings.
