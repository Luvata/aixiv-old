Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new model called **ByteFormer** that can perform classification directly on file bytes, without the need for decoding files into a modality-specific form (such as RGB tensors for images or MFCCs for audio).
- **Why**: The paper argues that operating on file bytes has several advantages over conventional approaches, such as enabling multi-modal inference, reducing input preprocessing, and enhancing privacy-preserving inference.
- **How**: The paper uses a transformer backbone with a byte embedding layer and a linear classifier to process file bytes. The paper evaluates ByteFormer on image and audio classification tasks and shows that it achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper also demonstrates ByteFormer's ability to handle obfuscated or masked inputs without loss of accuracy.

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It introduces **ByteFormer**, a new model that can perform classification directly on file bytes, without the need for decoding files into a modality-specific form (such as RGB tensors for images or MFCCs for audio).
- It shows that ByteFormer can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on image and audio classification tasks, using a transformer backbone with a byte embedding layer and a linear classifier.
- It demonstrates that ByteFormer has applications in privacy-preserving inference, as it can handle obfuscated or masked inputs without loss of accuracy. It also proposes a hypothetical privacy-preserving camera that avoids forming full images by consistently masking 90% of pixel channels.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper describes the architecture of **ByteFormer**, which consists of a byte embedding layer, a transformer backbone, and a linear classifier. The byte embedding layer maps each byte in the input file to a 256-dimensional vector. The transformer backbone processes the byte embeddings and outputs a feature vector for each byte. The linear classifier takes the average of the feature vectors and produces a class prediction.
- The paper details the training procedure of ByteFormer, which involves using a cross-entropy loss function, an AdamW optimizer, and a cosine learning rate scheduler. The paper also applies data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering for image files, and random cropping and time shifting for audio files.
- The paper evaluates ByteFormer on two image classification datasets (ImageNet and CIFAR-10) and one audio classification dataset (Speech Commands v2). The paper compares ByteFormer with state-of-the-art methods that operate on RGB tensors or MFCCs, such as ViTs, ResNets, and CNNs. The paper also ablates different components of ByteFormer, such as the byte embedding layer, the transformer backbone, and the linear classifier.
