Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel framework to segment anything in 3D, named SA3D, which can take a neural radiance field (NeRF) model as input and produce the 3D segmentation result of any target object via one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to generalize the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can segment any object or part in 2D images, to 3D scenes and objects, which are more challenging and valuable for scene perception[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper leverages the density-guided inverse rendering technique to project the 2D segmentation mask obtained by SAM onto 3D mask grids, and then uses cross-view self-prompts to refine the masks iteratively until accurate 3D masks are learned[^1^][1]. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of SA3D on various radiance fields without any additional redesigning[^1^][1].

The paper claims the following contributions[^1^][1]:

- It proposes a novel framework to segment anything in 3D, named SA3D, which can take a neural radiance field (NeRF) model as input and produce the 3D segmentation result of any target object via one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view.
- It leverages the density-guided inverse rendering technique to project the 2D segmentation mask obtained by SAM onto 3D mask grids, and then uses cross-view self-prompts to refine the masks iteratively until accurate 3D masks are learned.
- It demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of SA3D on various radiance fields without any additional redesigning, and shows that SA3D can segment 3D objects with complex shapes and textures in different scenes.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper presents the overall framework of SA3D, which consists of three main components: SAM, density-guided inverse rendering, and cross-view self-prompts[^1^][1].
- The paper describes how SAM can segment any target object in a single rendered view given a manual prompt, which can be a bounding box or a scribble on the object[^1^][1].
- The paper explains how the density-guided inverse rendering technique can project the 2D segmentation mask onto 3D mask grids, which are aligned with the NeRF model and store the occupancy probability of each voxel[^1^][1].
- The paper illustrates how the cross-view self-prompts can improve the 3D segmentation result by rendering 2D masks from other views and feeding them back to SAM, which can fill in the missing parts and correct the errors[^1^][1].
- The paper details how the iterative process can converge to accurate 3D masks by updating the mask grids and rendering new views until no significant change is observed[^1^][1].

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a NeRF model and a manual prompt on a rendered view
# Output: a 3D segmentation mask of the target object

# Initialize the 3D mask grids with zeros
mask_grids = zeros(shape=(H, W, D))

# Segment the target object in the prompted view using SAM
mask_2d = SAM(prompt, view)

# Project the 2D mask onto the 3D mask grids using density-guided inverse rendering
mask_grids = project(mask_2d, mask_grids, view)

# Repeat until convergence
while not converged:

  # Render 2D masks from other views using NeRF and mask grids
  masks_2d = render(mask_grids, views)

  # Use the rendered masks as cross-view self-prompts to segment the target object in each view using SAM
  masks_2d = SAM(masks_2d, views)

  # Project the refined 2D masks onto the 3D mask grids using density-guided inverse rendering
  mask_grids = project(masks_2d, mask_grids, views)

  # Check if the mask grids have changed significantly
  converged = check(mask_grids)

# Return the final 3D segmentation mask
return mask_grids
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: a NeRF model and a manual prompt on a rendered view
# Output: a 3D segmentation mask of the target object

# Define some hyperparameters
H = 128 # the height of the mask grids
W = 128 # the width of the mask grids
D = 128 # the depth of the mask grids
N = 8 # the number of views to render
T = 0.5 # the threshold for occupancy probability
E = 0.01 # the epsilon for convergence check

# Initialize the 3D mask grids with zeros
mask_grids = zeros(shape=(H, W, D))

# Segment the target object in the prompted view using SAM
mask_2d = SAM(prompt, view)

# Project the 2D mask onto the 3D mask grids using density-guided inverse rendering
# For each pixel in the 2D mask
for i in range(H):
  for j in range(W):
    # Get the pixel value (0 or 1)
    value = mask_2d[i][j]
    # Get the corresponding ray direction from the view
    ray_dir = view.get_ray_dir(i, j)
    # Get the density values along the ray from the NeRF model
    density = NeRF.get_density(ray_dir)
    # Normalize the density values to sum to one
    density = density / sum(density)
    # For each voxel along the ray
    for k in range(D):
      # Update the mask grid value by adding the product of pixel value and density value
      mask_grids[i][j][k] += value * density[k]

# Repeat until convergence
while not converged:

  # Render 2D masks from other views using NeRF and mask grids
  masks_2d = []
  # For each view
  for view in views:
    # Initialize an empty 2D mask
    mask_2d = zeros(shape=(H, W))
    # For each pixel in the 2D mask
    for i in range(H):
      for j in range(W):
        # Get the corresponding ray direction from the view
        ray_dir = view.get_ray_dir(i, j)
        # Get the occupancy probability along the ray from the mask grids
        occupancy = mask_grids.get_occupancy(ray_dir)
        # Set the pixel value to one if the occupancy probability is greater than a threshold, otherwise zero
        if occupancy > T:
          mask_2d[i][j] = 1
        else:
          mask_2d[i][j] = 0
    # Append the rendered mask to the list of masks
    masks_2d.append(mask_2d)

  # Use the rendered masks as cross-view self-prompts to segment the target object in each view using SAM
  masks_2d = SAM(masks_2d, views)

  # Project the refined 2D masks onto the 3D mask grids using density-guided inverse rendering
  # For each view and each pixel in the corresponding mask
  for view, mask_2d in zip(views, masks_2d):
    for i in range(H):
      for j in range(W):
        # Get the pixel value (0 or 1)
        value = mask_2d[i][j]
        # Get the corresponding ray direction from the view
        ray_dir = view.get_ray_dir(i, j)
        # Get the density values along the ray from the NeRF model
        density = NeRF.get_density(ray_dir)
        # Normalize the density values to sum to one
        density = density / sum(density)
        # For each voxel along the ray
        for k in range(D):
          # Update the mask grid value by adding the product of pixel value and density value
          mask_grids[i][j][k] += value * density[k]

  # Check if the mask grids have changed significantly by computing their L1 norm difference with previous iteration
  diff = L1_norm(mask_grids - prev_mask_grids)
  if diff < E:
    converged = True

# Return the final 3D segmentation mask by binarizing it with a threshold T
return binarize(mask_grids, T)
