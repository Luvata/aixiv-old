Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a fine-tuning method for aligning text-to-image models using human feedback.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the quality of text-to-image synthesis by generating images that are more accurately aligned with text prompts.
- **How**: The paper uses a three-stage method that consists of: (1) collecting human feedback assessing model output alignment from a set of diverse text prompts, (2) training a reward function that predicts human feedback using the human-labeled image-text dataset, and (3) fine-tuning the text-to-image model by maximizing reward-weighted likelihood to improve image-text alignment.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The method consists of three stages: **human feedback collection**, **reward function training**, and **text-to-image model fine-tuning**.
- In the human feedback collection stage, the authors use a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate images from a set of diverse text prompts, and then ask human annotators to rate the alignment between the images and the text prompts on a scale of 1 to 5.
- In the reward function training stage, the authors use the human-labeled image-text dataset to train a reward function that predicts human feedback. The reward function is a neural network that takes an image and a text prompt as inputs and outputs a scalar reward value. The reward function is trained by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted reward and the human feedback.
- In the text-to-image model fine-tuning stage, the authors use the reward function to fine-tune the text-to-image model by maximizing reward-weighted likelihood. The reward-weighted likelihood is defined as the product of the reward function and the likelihood of generating an image given a text prompt. The authors use gradient ascent to update the text-to-image model parameters.
