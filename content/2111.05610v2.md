Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a new framework for video-text retrieval called CLIP2TV, which consists of two modules: a video-text alignment module and a video-text matching module. The alignment module aims to align the video and text features at different levels of granularity, such as frame-level, clip-level, and video-level. The matching module aims to learn a similarity function that can measure the relevance between videos and texts. The paper adopts CLIP-based encoders for both video and text, and uses cross-modal attention and contrastive learning to enhance the alignment and matching abilities of transformers.
- The paper also introduces similarity distillation to address the problem of data noise in some datasets, such as vague description, typo, and misdescription. The paper proposes to use a teacher-student framework, where the teacher model is trained on a clean dataset and the student model is trained on a noisy dataset. The paper uses the teacher model to generate soft labels for the noisy data, and uses them to guide the student model to learn a better similarity function. The paper also proposes some strategies to deal with different types of noise, such as filtering, correcting, and augmenting.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments on various datasets and configurations, such as MSR-VTT, LSMDC, YouCook2, ActivityNet Captions, and HowTo100M. The paper evaluates the proposed framework on different metrics, such as Recall@K, Median Rank (MedR), Mean Rank (MeanR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). The paper compares the proposed framework with previous state-of-the-art methods, such as HERO [44], CLIP4Clip [41], VATT [18], etc. The paper shows that CLIP2TV achieves better or competitive results on common datasets of various length of video clips.
