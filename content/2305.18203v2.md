Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to decompose a visual concept, represented as a set of images, into different visual aspects encoded in a hierarchical tree structure.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide a tool for visual exploration and inspiration, by allowing users to discover and combine sub-concepts of an object of interest, and to apply them to new designs using natural language sentences.
- **How**: The paper utilizes large vision-language models and their rich latent space for concept decomposition and generation. Each node in the tree represents a sub-concept using a learned vector embedding injected into the latent space of a pretrained text-to-image model. The paper uses a set of regularizations to guide the optimization of the embedding vectors encoded in the nodes to follow the hierarchical structure of the tree. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on various visual concepts and shows how it can be used for creative design tasks.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper at , the contributions are:

- A novel method to decompose a visual concept into different aspects using a hierarchical tree structure and large vision-language models.
- A way to explore and sample the hidden sub-concepts of an object using the tree structure and the latent space of a text-to-image model.
- A technique to combine aspects within and across trees to create new visual ideas, and to use natural language sentences to apply such aspects to new designs.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the method on various visual concepts and creative design tasks, showing its advantages over existing methods.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper at  can be summarized as follows:

- The paper defines a visual concept as a set of images that share some common characteristics, such as shape, color, texture, etc. The paper assumes that each concept can be decomposed into different aspects that capture its variations and nuances.
- The paper represents each aspect as a node in a hierarchical tree structure, where the root node corresponds to the whole concept and the leaf nodes correspond to the most specific aspects. Each node is associated with a vector embedding that encodes its visual features in the latent space of a pretrained text-to-image model (DALL-E).
- The paper proposes an optimization procedure to learn the embedding vectors for each node in the tree, given an initial set of images for the concept. The paper uses a set of regularizations to ensure that the embeddings follow the hierarchical structure of the tree, such as similarity, diversity, and consistency constraints.
- The paper describes how to use the learned tree structure and embeddings for visual exploration and inspiration. The paper shows how to sample new images for each node using DALL-E's decoder, how to combine aspects within and across trees using arithmetic operations on the embeddings, and how to apply aspects to new designs using natural language sentences as inputs to DALL-E's encoder.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper at :

```python
# Define a visual concept as a set of images
concept = load_images(concept_name)

# Initialize a hierarchical tree structure for the concept
tree = initialize_tree(concept)

# Preload a pretrained text-to-image model (DALL-E)
model = load_model("DALL-E")

# Learn the embedding vectors for each node in the tree
for node in tree.nodes:
  # Initialize the embedding vector randomly
  node.embedding = random_vector()
  # Optimize the embedding vector using gradient descent
  for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    # Sample an image from the node using DALL-E's decoder
    node.image = model.decode(node.embedding)
    # Compute the reconstruction loss between the sampled image and the concept images
    node.loss = reconstruction_loss(node.image, concept)
    # Add regularizations to enforce the hierarchical structure of the tree
    node.loss += similarity_loss(node, tree) # make siblings similar
    node.loss += diversity_loss(node, tree) # make children diverse
    node.loss += consistency_loss(node, tree) # make parent consistent with children
    # Update the embedding vector using the gradient of the loss
    node.embedding -= learning_rate * gradient(node.loss, node.embedding)

# Use the learned tree structure and embeddings for visual exploration and inspiration
# Sample new images for each node using DALL-E's decoder
for node in tree.nodes:
  node.image = model.decode(node.embedding)

# Combine aspects within and across trees using arithmetic operations on the embeddings
new_embedding = tree1.node1.embedding + tree2.node2.embedding - tree3.node3.embedding
new_image = model.decode(new_embedding)

# Apply aspects to new designs using natural language sentences as inputs to DALL-E's encoder
new_sentence = "a car with " + tree.node4.name
new_embedding = model.encode(new_sentence)
new_image = model.decode(new_embedding)
