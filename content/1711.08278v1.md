Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper introduces a neuron-level Selective Context Aggregation (SCA) module for scene segmentation, which is a task of assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve scene segmentation by modeling contextual information, which provides important cues for disambiguating visually similar pixels. Existing methods either ignore context or use it in a fixed or predefined way, which limits their performance and generalization.
- **How**: The paper proposes a novel mechanism that consists of two components: a contextual dependency predictor and a context aggregation operator. The dependency predictor is a neural network that learns to infer contextual dependencies between different image regions from data. The context aggregation operator uses the predicted dependencies to selectively augment local representations with global context at each neuron. The proposed method can be integrated with any convolutional neural network (CNN) for scene segmentation and is trained end-to-end.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a **neuron-level Selective Context Aggregation (SCA) module** for scene segmentation, which consists of two components: a **contextual dependency predictor** and a **context aggregation operator**.
- The **contextual dependency predictor** is a neural network that takes as input a feature map from a CNN and outputs a dependency map that indicates the contextual dependencies between different image regions. The dependency map is learned implicitly from data without any explicit supervision or prior knowledge. The paper uses a fully convolutional network (FCN) with dilated convolutions as the dependency predictor.
- The **context aggregation operator** uses the dependency map to selectively aggregate global context at each neuron. The global context is computed by applying average pooling to the feature map. The context aggregation operator then performs element-wise multiplication between the global context and the dependency map, followed by element-wise addition with the local feature map. The paper shows that this operator is differentiable and can be integrated with any CNN for scene segmentation.
- The paper integrates the proposed SCA module with two CNNs for scene segmentation: FCN-VGG16 and DeepLab-V2. The paper trains the models end-to-end using standard cross-entropy loss on two challenging scene segmentation datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes.
