Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), a simple compression-based technique to counter perturbative availability poisons (PAPs), which are small changes added to images to prevent their use for model training.

Why: The paper challenges the belief that PAPs are hard to counter and shows that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to ISS, which can restore the model accuracy significantly.

How: The paper conducts extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with different types of PAP methods and surrogate models. The paper also investigates the properties of PAP perturbations and explains why ISS works well for different types of PAPs. The paper further tests adaptive poisoning and shows that it is not an ideal defense against ISS.

Here are some of the contributions of this paper:

- It proposes Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), a simple compression-based technique to counter PAPs, which outperforms previous preprocessing-based countermeasures and adversarial training.
- It categorizes 12 PAP methods into three types based on the surrogate models they use and investigates the properties of PAP perturbations.
- It explains why ISS works well for different types of PAPs and shows its generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and higher efficiency.
- It tests adaptive poisoning and shows that it is not an ideal defense against ISS.

Here is a summary of the method section:

```
The method section consists of four subsections: ISS, PAP methods, Adaptive poisoning, and Evaluation metrics.

- ISS: The authors describe how they apply different compression techniques (JPEG, PNG, and WebP) to remove PAP perturbations from images. They also explain how they select the optimal compression parameters for each type of PAP method based on the surrogate model used for poison generation.
- PAP methods: The authors categorize 12 PAP methods into three types based on the surrogate model they use: slightly-trained, pre-trained, and untrained. They also provide the details of each PAP method and the corresponding perturbation norms and magnitudes.
- Adaptive poisoning: The authors propose a stronger poisoning strategy that adapts to ISS by generating poisons using a compressed surrogate model. They also discuss the limitations and challenges of this strategy.
- Evaluation metrics: The authors define two metrics to evaluate the performance of ISS and PAP methods: accuracy drop and accuracy restoration. They also explain how they compute these metrics for different datasets and models.
