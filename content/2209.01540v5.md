According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- They propose a fully end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET), which can learn from masked visual modeling (MVM) supervision at the pixel level, without relying on any intermediate feature extraction or quantization.
- They systematically explore eight different reconstructive targets of MVM, from low-level to high-level visual representations, and provide insights into the factors leading to effective MVM training.
- They conduct comprehensive experiments on 13 video-language (VidL) benchmarks, covering various VidL tasks such as video question answering, video captioning, and text-to-video retrieval. They show that VIOLET pre-trained with MVM objective achieves notable improvements over previous methods and sets new state-of-the-art results on several datasets.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a fully end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET), which consists of a video encoder, a text encoder, and a cross-modal encoder. The video encoder takes raw video frames as input and applies convolutional layers and self-attention layers to extract visual features. The text encoder takes word tokens as input and applies self-attention layers to extract textual features. The cross-modal encoder takes the output of both encoders and applies cross-attention layers to fuse the visual and textual information.
- The paper introduces a masked visual modeling (MVM) objective for video-language (VidL) pre-training, which aims to reconstruct masked visual inputs based on the surrounding context. The paper explores eight different reconstructive targets of MVM, namely pixel values, oriented gradients, depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens, latent visual features, frame-level features, and clip-level features. The paper compares the performance of different MVM targets on downstream VidL tasks and analyzes the factors that affect the effectiveness of MVM training.
- The paper conducts comprehensive experiments on 13 VidL benchmarks, covering various VidL tasks such as video question answering, video captioning, and text-to-video retrieval. The paper shows that VIOLET pre-trained with MVM objective achieves notable improvements over previous methods and sets new state-of-the-art results on several datasets. The paper also provides ablation studies and qualitative analysis to demonstrate the benefits of VIOLET and MVM.
