Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes ZeroCap, a zero-shot image-to-text generation method that combines a visual-semantic model with a large language model.

Why: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of supervised captioning methods that require curated data and are restricted by the training distribution. The paper also demonstrates the flexibility and capability of ZeroCap to perform visual-semantic arithmetic tasks.

How: The paper uses CLIP, a contrastive learning model, to score the relevance of an image and a text. The paper then uses GPT-3, a large language model, to generate candidate texts given an image or a combination of images and texts. The paper selects the best text based on the CLIP score and evaluates it on various datasets and tasks.

- A novel zero-shot image-to-text generation method that leverages both visual-semantic and language models without any fine-tuning or additional data.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on several captioning datasets, showing that it outperforms supervised methods on diversity and relevance metrics.

Here is a summary of the method section:

```
The method consists of three main steps: text generation, text scoring, and text selection.

- Text generation: Given an image or a combination of images and texts as input, the method uses GPT-3 to generate a set of candidate texts. The input is formatted as a prompt that specifies the task and the desired output length. For example, for captioning an image, the input is "Describe this image in one sentence: [image]". For visual-semantic arithmetic, the input is "Complete this analogy: [image1] is to [text1] as [image2] is to [text2]. Answer in one word: [text2]".

- Text scoring: Given a set of candidate texts, the method uses CLIP to score their relevance to the input. CLIP is a visual-semantic model that learns a joint embedding space for images and texts using contrastive learning. The method computes the cosine similarity between the CLIP embeddings of the input and each candidate text, and assigns a score to each text.

- Text selection: Given a set of scored candidate texts, the method selects the best one based on the highest score. The method also applies some post-processing steps to filter out invalid or duplicate texts.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
function ZeroCap(input):
  # input is an image or a combination of images and texts
  # output is a text that describes or completes the input

  # generate a set of candidate texts using GPT-3
  candidates = GPT3_generate(input)

  # score each candidate text using CLIP
  scores = []
  for text in candidates:
    score = CLIP_score(input, text)
    scores.append(score)

  # select the best text based on the highest score
  best_text = select_best(candidates, scores)

  # return the best text
  return best_text
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```
function ZeroCap(input):
  # input is an image or a combination of images and texts
  # output is a text that describes or completes the input

  # load the GPT-3 and CLIP models
  gpt3 = load_GPT3()
  clip = load_CLIP()

  # format the input as a prompt for GPT-3
  prompt = format_prompt(input)

  # generate a set of candidate texts using GPT-3
  candidates = []
  for i in range(num_candidates):
    text = gpt3.generate(prompt, max_length=max_length, stop=stop_token)
    candidates.append(text)

  # score each candidate text using CLIP
  scores = []
  for text in candidates:
    # encode the input and the text using CLIP
    input_embedding = clip.encode_image_or_text(input)
    text_embedding = clip.encode_text(text)

    # compute the cosine similarity between the embeddings
    score = cosine_similarity(input_embedding, text_embedding)
    scores.append(score)

  # select the best text based on the highest score
  best_index = argmax(scores)
  best_text = candidates[best_index]

  # apply some post-processing steps to filter out invalid or duplicate texts
  best_text = post_process(best_text)

  # return the best text
  return best_text
