Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces **TextDiffuser**, a system that can generate images with visually appealing text that is coherent with backgrounds, using text prompts alone or together with text template images. It also contributes a large-scale text images dataset called **MARIO-10M** and an evaluation benchmark called **MARIO-Eval**.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the issue that diffusion models, which have impressive generation abilities, struggle with rendering accurate and coherent text. The paper also wants to provide a flexible and controllable way to create high-quality text images for various applications such as graphic design, advertising, and education.
- **How**: The paper proposes a two-stage approach: first, a Transformer model generates the layout of keywords extracted from text prompts, and then diffusion models generate images conditioned on the text prompt and the generated layout. The paper also leverages OCR annotations to train the diffusion models and evaluate the text rendering quality. The paper conducts experiments and user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of TextDiffuser over existing methods.


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the contributions are:

- The first system that can generate images with visually appealing text that is coherent with backgrounds, using text prompts alone or together with text template images, and conduct text inpainting to reconstruct incomplete images with text.
- The first large-scale text images dataset with OCR annotations, MARIO-10M, containing 10 million image-text pairs with text recognition, detection, and character-level segmentation annotations.
- The first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text rendering quality, MARIO-Eval, which covers various aspects such as text readability, alignment, style consistency, and semantic coherence.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a two-stage approach for generating text images: **text layout generation** and **text image generation**.
- In the text layout generation stage, the paper uses a Transformer model to generate the layout of keywords extracted from text prompts. The layout consists of bounding boxes and text styles for each keyword. The paper also introduces a novel loss function to encourage the layout to be coherent with the text prompt and the text template image (if provided).
- In the text image generation stage, the paper uses diffusion models to generate images conditioned on the text prompt and the generated layout. The paper leverages OCR annotations to train the diffusion models and improve the text rendering quality. The paper also introduces a novel attention mechanism to allow the diffusion models to focus on different regions of the image at different steps.
- The paper also extends the method to conduct text inpainting, which is to reconstruct incomplete images with text. The paper modifies the diffusion models to take an additional mask input that indicates the missing regions of the image. The paper also modifies the attention mechanism to allow the diffusion models to attend to both the original and inpainted regions of the image.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
# Input: text prompt T, text template image I (optional)
# Output: text image G

# Text layout generation
keywords = extract_keywords(T) # use a keyword extraction model
layout = Transformer(keywords, I) # use a Transformer model to generate layout
layout = post_process(layout) # use a post-processing module to refine layout

# Text image generation
G = initialize_image() # use a random or constant initialization
for t in reverse(range(1, T)): # use a reverse diffusion process
  noise = sample_noise(t) # use a noise schedule
  G = denoise(G + noise, T, layout) # use a denoising diffusion model
G = enhance(G) # use an enhancement module to improve quality

# Text inpainting (optional)
# Input: text prompt T, incomplete image M with mask R
# Output: inpainted image G

# Text layout generation (same as above)
keywords = extract_keywords(T)
layout = Transformer(keywords, M)
layout = post_process(layout)

# Text inpainting
G = initialize_image(M, R) # use the incomplete image and mask for initialization
for t in reverse(range(1, T)):
  noise = sample_noise(t)
  G = inpaint(G + noise, T, layout, M, R) # use a modified inpainting diffusion model
G = enhance(G)
```


## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```
# Input: text prompt T, text template image I (optional)
# Output: text image G

# Text layout generation
keywords = extract_keywords(T) # use a keyword extraction model such as RAKE
layout = Transformer(keywords, I) # use a Transformer model with the following components:
  # Encoder: encode the keywords and the text template image (if provided) into latent representations
  # Decoder: decode the latent representations into bounding boxes and text styles for each keyword
  # Loss: use a combination of L1 loss, KL divergence, and coherence loss to optimize the layout
layout = post_process(layout) # use a post-processing module to refine layout by:
  # Removing overlapping or out-of-bound boxes
  # Adjusting box sizes and positions according to text styles
  # Resizing and padding the layout to match the desired image size

# Text image generation
G = initialize_image() # use a random or constant initialization
for t in reverse(range(1, T)): # use a reverse diffusion process
  noise = sample_noise(t) # use a noise schedule such as linear or cosine
  G = denoise(G + noise, T, layout) # use a denoising diffusion model with the following components:
    # Encoder: encode the noisy image into a latent representation
    # Decoder: decode the latent representation into a clean image
    # Attention: use a novel attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on different regions of the image at different steps
    # Loss: use a combination of L2 loss, KL divergence, and OCR loss to optimize the image
G = enhance(G) # use an enhancement module such as StyleGAN2-ADA to improve quality

# Text inpainting (optional)

# Output: inpainted image G

# Text layout generation (same as above)
keywords = extract_keywords(T)

# Text inpainting
G = initialize_image(M, R) # use the incomplete image and mask for initialization
for t in reverse(range(1, T)):
  noise = sample_noise(t)
  G = inpaint(G + noise, T, layout, M, R) # use a modified inpainting diffusion model with the following components:
    # Encoder: encode the noisy image and the mask into a latent representation
    # Decoder: decode the latent representation into an inpainted image
    # Attention: use a modified attention mechanism to allow the model to attend to both the original and inpainted regions of the image
    # Loss: use a combination of L2 loss, KL divergence, OCR loss, and mask loss to optimize the image
