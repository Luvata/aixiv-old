Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes CLIP-GEN, a self-supervised scheme for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. CLIP-GEN only requires a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator.

Why: The paper aims to address the challenge of training a text-to-image generator in the general domain without paired text-image data, which is too expensive to collect. The paper also aims to improve the image quality and text-image matching over optimization-based methods.

How: The paper uses the following steps to train and generate images from text:
- Given an image without text labels, extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP.
- Convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space.
- Train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation.
- Given an input text, extract the text embedding from the text encoder of CLIP and generate coherent image tokens with the transformer.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The method section of the paper consists of four subsections: overview, image embedding, image tokenization, and text-to-image generation.

- Overview: The paper gives an overview of the proposed CLIP-GEN scheme, which consists of three components: a pre-trained CLIP model, a VQGAN model, and an autoregressive transformer. The paper also introduces the notation and the objective function of the scheme.

- Image embedding: The paper describes how to use the image encoder of CLIP to extract the image embedding in the unified language-vision embedding space. The paper also explains how to use a contrastive loss to align the image embedding with the text embedding.

- Image tokenization: The paper describes how to use the VQGAN model to convert an image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space. The paper also explains how to use a reconstruction loss to preserve the image quality.

- Text-to-image generation: The paper describes how to use an autoregressive transformer to map the image tokens from the unified language-vision representation. The paper also explains how to use a cross-entropy loss to train the transformer and how to generate images from text inputs.
