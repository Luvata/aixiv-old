Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents **SpaText**, a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control. It allows the user to control the shapes and layout of different regions or objects in the image by providing a segmentation map and a free-form natural language description for each region.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of previous text-to-image diffusion models, which are able to generate high-quality images but lack fine-grained control over the scene composition. The paper also addresses the challenge of lacking large-scale datasets that have detailed textual descriptions for each region in the image.
- **How**: The paper leverages the current large-scale text-to-image datasets and bases its approach on a novel CLIP-based spatio-textual representation, which measures the similarity between image patches and text tokens. The paper shows how to extend the classifier-free guidance method in diffusion models to the multi-conditional case and presents an alternative accelerated inference algorithm. The paper evaluates its method on two state-of-the-art diffusion models: pixel-based and latent-based, and compares it with several baselines using automatic metrics, FID scores, and a user study.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **SpaText**, a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control, which allows the user to provide a segmentation map and a free-form natural language description for each region of interest in the image.
- A novel **CLIP-based spatio-textual representation**, which measures the similarity between image patches and text tokens, and enables leveraging the current large-scale text-to-image datasets without requiring detailed textual annotations for each region in the image.
- An extension of the **classifier-free guidance method** in diffusion models to the **multi-conditional case**, which allows generating images conditioned on multiple sources of information, such as global text prompt, segmentation map, and region descriptions.

- Several **automatic evaluation metrics** for image generation with free-form textual scene control, such as segmentation accuracy, region-text alignment, and diversity score, as well as FID scores and a user study to compare with several baselines and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control, called **SpaText**. The method consists of three main components: a **segmentation map**, a **global text prompt**, and a **region description** for each region of interest in the image.
- The segmentation map is a binary mask that indicates the boundaries of different regions or objects in the image. The user can provide the segmentation map manually or use an off-the-shelf segmentation model to generate it automatically.
- The global text prompt is a short natural language description that summarizes the entire scene. The user can provide the global text prompt or use a default one such as "A realistic image".
- The region description is a free-form natural language description that specifies the appearance and attributes of each region or object in the image. The user can provide the region description or use a default one such as "A random object".
- The paper introduces a novel **CLIP-based spatio-textual representation**, which measures the similarity between image patches and text tokens using a pre-trained CLIP model. The paper uses this representation to encode the segmentation map, the global text prompt, and the region descriptions into a single spatio-textual embedding, which serves as the conditioning input for the diffusion models.
- The paper shows how to extend the **classifier-free guidance method** in diffusion models to the **multi-conditional case**, which allows generating images conditioned on multiple sources of information, such as global text prompt, segmentation map, and region descriptions. The paper uses a learned energy function to guide the diffusion process towards generating images that match the conditioning input.
- The paper presents an alternative **accelerated inference algorithm** for diffusion models, which reduces the number of forward passes by using a coarse-to-fine strategy and a learned mask predictor. The paper uses this algorithm to speed up the image generation process and improve the quality of the results.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```python
# Input: segmentation map S, global text prompt T, region descriptions R
# Output: generated image X

# Encode the segmentation map, the global text prompt, and the region descriptions into a spatio-textual embedding E using CLIP
E = encode(S, T, R)

# Initialize the image X with random noise
X = random_noise()

# Define the number of diffusion steps N and the noise schedule beta
N = 1000
beta = [0.0001, 0.0002, ..., 0.02]

# Define the coarse-to-fine resolution levels L and the mask predictor M
L = [4, 8, 16, ..., 256]
M = MaskPredictor()

# Loop over the resolution levels from coarse to fine
for l in L:

  # Resize the image X and the spatio-textual embedding E to the current resolution level l
  X = resize(X, l)
  E = resize(E, l)

  # Loop over the diffusion steps from N to 1
  for t in range(N, 0, -1):

    # Compute the noise level sigma according to the noise schedule beta
    sigma = sqrt(beta[t] / (1 - beta[t]))

    # Add Gaussian noise to the image X with standard deviation sigma
    X = X + normal(0, sigma)

    # Predict a mask M_t that indicates which pixels to update at the current step t using the mask predictor M
    M_t = M(X, E, t)

    # Compute the energy function E_t that measures how well the image X matches the spatio-textual embedding E using a neural network
    E_t = Energy(X, E)

    # Compute the gradient of the energy function with respect to the image X
    grad_E_t = gradient(E_t, X)

    # Update the image X by moving it along the negative gradient direction with a small step size epsilon
    X = X - epsilon * grad_E_t

    # Apply the mask M_t to the image X to keep only the updated pixels and revert the rest to their previous values
    X = X * M_t + X_prev * (1 - M_t)

    # Store the current image X as X_prev for the next step
    X_prev = X

# Return the final image X as the output
return X
