Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper proposes a novel Video-Language pre-training method called Clover, which aims to build a universal model for various video understanding tasks such as text-video retrieval and video question answering.
- Why: The paper argues that existing Video-Language models have to compromise between efficiency and performance, and they mostly adopt different architectures for different downstream tasks. This is because the pair-wise training cannot well align and fuse features from different modalities.
- How: The paper introduces a tri-modal alignment pre-training task that improves cross-modal feature alignment and fusion by learning from video, text, and audio data simultaneously. The paper also enhances the tri-modal alignment by incorporating learning from semantic masked samples and a new pair-wise ranking loss. The paper evaluates Clover on multiple downstream tasks and shows that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel Video-Language pre-training method called Clover that can better correlate the cross-modal features and achieve a universal model for various video understanding tasks.
- A tri-modal alignment pre-training task that leverages video, text, and audio data to improve cross-modal feature alignment and fusion.
- A semantic masking strategy and a pair-wise ranking loss that further enhance the tri-modal alignment and the quality of the learned features.
- Extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of Clover. Clover establishes new state-of-the-arts on three retrieval tasks for both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, and eight video question answering tasks.

## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper adopts a three-encoder architecture that consists of a video encoder, a text encoder, and a cross-modal encoder. The video encoder processes the video frames and audio clips separately and then fuses them into a single video representation. The text encoder processes the text captions or questions and generates a text representation. The cross-modal encoder takes the video and text representations as input and outputs a fused representation that captures the cross-modal interaction and correlation.
- The paper proposes a tri-modal alignment pre-training task that aims to learn the alignment and fusion of video, text, and audio features. The task is formulated as a classification problem where the model is given a video-text-audio triplet and asked to predict whether they are matched or not. The paper uses two types of negative samples: random negative samples that are randomly sampled from other triplets, and semantic negative samples that are generated by masking some words or frames in the positive samples. The paper argues that semantic negative samples can provide more challenging and informative learning signals for the model.
- The paper also introduces a pair-wise ranking loss that complements the tri-modal alignment task. The loss encourages the model to rank the positive samples higher than the negative samples based on their similarity scores. The paper claims that this loss can help the model learn fine-grained feature alignment and avoid trivial solutions.
- The paper pre-trains Clover on a large-scale video-text-audio dataset called HowTo100M [18], which contains over 100 million instructional videos with captions and audio tracks. The paper uses various data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, scaling, and masking to increase the diversity and robustness of the pre-training data. The paper also fine-tunes Clover on different downstream tasks using task-specific losses and evaluation metrics.
