Here is a summary of the paper in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes **Diffusion Hyperfeatures**, a framework for consolidating multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from the diffusion process into per-pixel feature descriptors that can be used for downstream tasks[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting useful descriptors from diffusion models, which have been shown to be capable of generating high-quality images and containing meaningful internal representations[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper introduces a feature aggregation network that takes as input the collection of intermediate feature maps from the diffusion process and produces as output a single descriptor map[^1^][1]. The paper evaluates the utility of Diffusion Hyperfeatures on the task of semantic keypoint correspondence and demonstrates that they achieve superior performance on the SPair-71k real image benchmark[^1^][1]. The paper also shows that the feature aggregation network is flexible and transferable across different domains and objects[^1^][1].

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It proposes a novel framework for extracting per-pixel feature descriptors from diffusion models that consolidate information from multiple scales and timesteps.
- It introduces a feature aggregation network that learns to mix the intermediate feature maps from the diffusion process in an interpretable way.
- It demonstrates the effectiveness of Diffusion Hyperfeatures on the task of semantic keypoint correspondence and shows that they outperform existing methods on the SPair-71k real image benchmark.
- It shows that the feature aggregation network trained on real image pairs can be applied to synthetic image pairs with unseen objects and compositions, indicating its flexibility and transferability.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of three subsections: Diffusion Models, Diffusion Hyperfeatures, and Feature Aggregation Network. Here is a summary of each subsection:

- **Diffusion Models**: The paper reviews the basics of diffusion models, which are generative models that learn to transform a data distribution into a simple noise distribution through a series of diffusion steps. The paper also describes how to invert a diffusion model given a real image, which involves finding the latent code that minimizes the reconstruction error between the original image and the generated image.
- **Diffusion Hyperfeatures**: The paper defines Diffusion Hyperfeatures as per-pixel feature descriptors that are extracted from the intermediate feature maps of the diffusion process. The paper explains how to obtain these feature maps for both synthetic and real images using the generation and inversion processes respectively. The paper also discusses the advantages of Diffusion Hyperfeatures over existing methods, such as their ability to capture semantic and geometric information across multiple scales and timesteps.
- **Feature Aggregation Network**: The paper introduces a feature aggregation network that takes as input the collection of intermediate feature maps from the diffusion process and produces as output a single descriptor map. The paper describes the architecture and training procedure of the network, which consists of a series of convolutional layers with residual connections and attention modules. The paper also shows how the network learns to assign different weights to different feature maps depending on their relevance for the task of semantic keypoint correspondence.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define a diffusion model
diffusion_model = DiffusionModel()

# Define a feature aggregation network
feature_aggregator = FeatureAggregator()

# Given a pair of images (synthetic or real), extract Diffusion Hyperfeatures
def extract_diffusion_hyperfeatures(image_pair):
  # Initialize an empty list to store the intermediate feature maps
  feature_maps = []
  # For each image in the pair
  for image in image_pair:
    # If the image is synthetic, use the generation process
    if image.is_synthetic():
      # Sample a latent code from the noise distribution
      latent_code = sample_noise()
      # For each diffusion timestep
      for timestep in range(num_timesteps):
        # Generate an intermediate image using the diffusion model
        intermediate_image = diffusion_model.generate(latent_code, timestep)
        # Extract the feature map from the diffusion model
        feature_map = diffusion_model.get_feature_map(intermediate_image, timestep)
        # Append the feature map to the list
        feature_maps.append(feature_map)
    # If the image is real, use the inversion process
    else:
      # Initialize a latent code randomly
      latent_code = random_init()
      # Optimize the latent code to minimize the reconstruction error
      latent_code = optimize_latent_code(diffusion_model, image, latent_code)
      # For each diffusion timestep
      for timestep in range(num_timesteps):
        # Generate an intermediate image using the diffusion model
        intermediate_image = diffusion_model.generate(latent_code, timestep)
        # Extract the feature map from the diffusion model
        feature_map = diffusion_model.get_feature_map(intermediate_image, timestep)
        # Append the feature map to the list
        feature_maps.append(feature_map)
  # Feed the collection of feature maps to the feature aggregation network
  descriptor_map = feature_aggregator(feature_maps)
  # Return the descriptor map as the Diffusion Hyperfeature
  return descriptor_map

# Given a pair of images and a set of keypoints, compute the correspondence score using Diffusion Hyperfeatures
def compute_correspondence_score(image_pair, keypoints):
  # Extract Diffusion Hyperfeatures for each image in the pair
  descriptor_map_1 = extract_diffusion_hyperfeatures(image_pair[0])
  descriptor_map_2 = extract_diffusion_hyperfeatures(image_pair[1])
  # Initialize a score variable to zero
  score = 0
  # For each keypoint in the set
  for keypoint in keypoints:
    # Get the coordinates of the keypoint in each image
    coord_1 = keypoint.get_coord(image_pair[0])
    coord_2 = keypoint.get_coord(image_pair[1])
    # Get the descriptors at those coordinates from the descriptor maps
    descriptor_1 = descriptor_map_1[coord_1]
    descriptor_2 = descriptor_map_2[coord_2]
    # Compute the cosine similarity between the descriptors
    similarity = cosine_similarity(descriptor_1, descriptor_2)
    # Add the similarity to the score variable
    score += similarity
  # Return the score as the correspondence score
  return score
