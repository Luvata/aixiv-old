Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper presents a model that generates natural language descriptions of images and their regions[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating dense and diverse descriptions of images that go beyond fixed vocabularies and templates[^2^][2].
- **How**: The paper develops a deep neural network model that infers the latent alignment between segments of sentences and the region of the image that they describe. The model associates the two modalities through a common, multimodal embedding space and a structured objective[^2^][2]. The paper also introduces a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions[^2^][2]. The paper evaluates the model on three datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO[^2^][2].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a **deep visual-semantic alignment model** that learns to associate segments of natural language sentences with regions in an image using a multimodal embedding space and a structured objective[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- The model consists of three components: a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that extracts features from image regions, a **bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** that encodes sentences into vectors, and a **common embedding space** that projects both image regions and sentence segments into a shared semantic space[^2^][2].
- The model is trained with a **structured max-margin objective** that encourages the correct alignment between an image and its description, while penalizing the incorrect ones[^2^][2].
- The paper also introduces a **Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (MRNN)** architecture that uses the inferred alignments to generate novel descriptions of image regions[^2^][2].
- The MRNN consists of two RNNs: a **language RNN** that generates words conditioned on the previous words and the image, and a **multimodal RNN** that fuses the information from the image region and the language RNN at each time step[^2^][2].
- The MRNN is trained with a **maximum likelihood objective** that maximizes the probability of generating the correct words given the image region and the previous words[^2^][2].
