Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method for **robust monocular depth estimation**, which is the task of predicting depth from a single image.
- **Why**: The paper addresses the challenge of acquiring **large and diverse training data** for monocular depth estimation across different environments. It also aims to improve the **generalization power** of the models by using **zero-shot cross-dataset transfer**, which means evaluating on datasets that were not seen during training.
- **How**: The paper develops tools that enable **mixing multiple datasets** during training, even if their annotations are incompatible. In particular, it proposes a **robust training objective** that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, advocates the use of **principled multi-objective learning** to combine data from different sources, and highlights the importance of **pretraining encoders** on auxiliary tasks. It also introduces a new, massive data source: **3D films**. It experiments with five diverse training datasets and shows that its approach outperforms competing methods across diverse datasets.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It proposes a robust training objective that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, and can handle missing or noisy depth values.
- It introduces a principled multi-objective learning framework that can balance the contributions of different datasets and optimize for multiple metrics simultaneously.
- It demonstrates the benefits of pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks such as semantic segmentation and surface normal estimation, which provide useful features for depth estimation.
- It leverages 3D films as a new source of data for monocular depth estimation, and shows how to extract depth maps from them using stereo matching and optical flow.
- It sets a new state of the art for monocular depth estimation on several benchmarks, and shows that its approach can generalize well across diverse datasets using zero-shot cross-dataset transfer.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- **Robust training objective**: The paper defines a loss function that consists of three terms: a scale-invariant error term that measures the relative depth difference between the prediction and the ground truth, a gradient matching term that encourages smoothness and edge preservation, and a normal consistency term that penalizes deviations from the surface normal direction. The paper also introduces a weighting scheme that downweights unreliable depth values based on their confidence or validity.
- **Multi-objective learning**: The paper formulates the problem of mixing multiple datasets as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each dataset corresponds to an objective function. The paper uses a Pareto-based approach to find a set of optimal solutions that trade off different objectives, and selects the best one based on a validation set. The paper also proposes a dynamic weighting scheme that adapts the weights of different datasets based on their difficulty and diversity.
- **Encoder pretraining**: The paper argues that pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks can improve the performance of monocular depth estimation, as these tasks provide useful features and priors for depth inference. The paper uses semantic segmentation and surface normal estimation as auxiliary tasks, and trains encoders on them using existing datasets. The paper then transfers the pretrained encoders to the depth estimation task and fine-tunes them on the mixed datasets.
- **3D film data**: The paper introduces 3D films as a new source of data for monocular depth estimation, and shows how to extract depth maps from them using stereo matching and optical flow. The paper collects a large dataset of 3D film frames and their corresponding depth maps, and uses them to augment the existing datasets for training. The paper also analyzes the characteristics and challenges of 3D film data, such as motion blur, occlusions, and artistic effects.
