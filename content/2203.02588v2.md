Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper is about improving the unconditional explicit bounds for the error term in the prime counting function ψ(x), which relates to the distribution of prime numbers.
- **Why**: The paper aims to refine the ideas of Pintz and Platt and Trudgian, who used the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function to estimate the error term. The paper claims that their approach can lead to sharper bounds for large values of x and also for small values of x with more computational effort.
- **How**: The paper splits the zeros into additional regions based on their imaginary parts and applies various techniques such as contour integration, Perron's formula, explicit formula, zero density estimates, and numerical computations to obtain improved bounds for each region. The paper also provides a comparison of their results with previous works and discusses some applications and extensions.

The paper claims to have the following contributions:

- They improve the unconditional explicit bounds for the error term in the prime counting function ψ(x) for all x > 2, and also for small values of x with more computational effort.
- They refine the ideas of Pintz and Platt and Trudgian by splitting the zeros of the zeta function into additional regions and carefully estimating the terms arising from each region.
- They use a significant amount of computational methods to obtain numerical constants and verify their results.
- They provide a comparison of their bounds with previous works and discuss some applications and extensions.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper uses the explicit formula for ψ(x) that relates it to the zeros of the zeta function and applies Perron's formula to obtain an integral representation of Eψ(x).
- The paper splits the integral into three parts: a main term, a secondary term, and a remainder term. The main term depends on the zeros with small imaginary parts, the secondary term depends on the zeros with moderate imaginary parts, and the remainder term depends on the zeros with large imaginary parts.
- The paper defines four regions for the zeros based on their imaginary parts: R1 for |t| ≤ 10^6, R2 for 10^6 < |t| ≤ 10^9, R3 for 10^9 < |t| ≤ 10^12, and R4 for |t| > 10^12. The paper also defines subregions within each region to handle different cases of x.
- The paper uses contour integration to estimate the main term and applies various zero density estimates to bound the number of zeros in each region and subregion. The paper also uses numerical computations to obtain constants and verify inequalities.
- The paper combines the estimates for each term and obtains improved bounds for Eψ(x) for all x > 2. The paper also provides some applications and extensions of their results.
