Here is a summary of the paper:

```
What: The paper proposes a new framework for image style transfer with a single text condition, without requiring a reference style image.

Why: The paper aims to address the practical situations where users may want to transfer styles by just imagining them, rather than having a specific style image in mind.

How: The paper uses the pre-trained text-image embedding model of CLIP to modulate the style of content images based on a text query. It also introduces a patch-wise text-image matching loss with multiview augmentations for realistic texture transfer.

Here are some of the contributions of the paper:

- It proposes a new framework that enables a style transfer without a style image, but only with a text description of the desired style.
- It uses the pre-trained text-image embedding model of CLIP to modulate the style of content images based on a text query.
- It introduces a patch-wise text-image matching loss with multiview augmentations for realistic texture transfer.
- It shows extensive experimental results that confirm the successful image style transfer with realistic textures that reflect semantic query texts.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

```
The method consists of three main components: a text encoder, an image encoder, and an image decoder.

- The text encoder is a pre-trained CLIP model that maps a text query to a high-dimensional feature vector.
- The image encoder is a convolutional neural network that maps an input content image to a latent representation.
- The image decoder is a convolutional neural network that maps the latent representation to a stylized output image.

The method uses two types of losses: a content loss and a style loss.

- The content loss is a perceptual loss that measures the similarity between the input and output images in terms of high-level features extracted by the image encoder.
- The style loss is a patch-wise text-image matching loss that measures the similarity between the output image patches and the text query in terms of CLIP embeddings. It also uses multiview augmentations to enhance the realism and diversity of the texture transfer.

Here is a high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```
# Define the text encoder, image encoder, and image decoder
text_encoder = CLIP()
image_encoder = CNN()
image_decoder = CNN()

# Define the content loss and style loss functions
content_loss = perceptual_loss(image_encoder)
style_loss = patchwise_text_image_matching_loss(text_encoder)

# Define the text query and the content image
text_query = "a text description of the desired style"
content_image = "an input image to be stylized"

# Encode the text query to a feature vector
text_feature = text_encoder(text_query)

# Encode the content image to a latent representation
latent_representation = image_encoder(content_image)

# Decode the latent representation to a stylized output image
output_image = image_decoder(latent_representation)

# Compute the total loss as a weighted sum of content loss and style loss
total_loss = alpha * content_loss(content_image, output_image) + beta * style_loss(output_image, text_feature)

# Update the parameters of the image decoder to minimize the total loss
image_decoder.optimize(total_loss)
```
