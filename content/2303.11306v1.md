Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper presents a technique to generate a collection of images that depicts variations in the shape of a specific object, enabling an object-level shape exploration process. The technique uses text-to-image diffusion models that switch between prompts along the denoising process to attain a variety of shape choices. The technique also introduces two methods to localize the image-space operation using the self-attention and cross-attention layers of the diffusion model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing text-to-image models that generate images globally and do not allow users to narrow their exploration to a particular object in the image. The paper also aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the localization methods for manipulating object shapes while respecting their semantics.
- **How**: The paper proposes a prompt-mixing technique that randomly selects a prompt from a set of prompts at each denoising step of the diffusion model. The prompts are designed to describe different shape variations of the same object. The paper also proposes two localization techniques that use the self-attention and cross-attention layers of the diffusion model to identify the region of interest in the image and apply the prompt-mixing operation only to that region. The first technique uses a mask-based approach that computes a soft mask from the self-attention weights and multiplies it with the cross-attention weights. The second technique uses a gradient-based approach that computes the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the input image and uses it as a saliency map to guide the prompt-mixing operation. The paper evaluates the proposed technique on several datasets and compares it with existing methods. The paper also shows some applications of the localization techniques for other tasks such as inpainting, super-resolution, and style transfer.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper uses a text-to-image diffusion model that generates images by denoising a noisy input image conditioned on a text prompt. The model consists of an encoder-decoder network with self-attention and cross-attention layers that learn to align the image and text features.
- The paper proposes a prompt-mixing technique that randomly selects a prompt from a set of prompts at each denoising step of the diffusion model. The prompts are designed to describe different shape variations of the same object. For example, for the object "car", the prompts could be "a car with a long hood", "a car with a flat roof", "a car with a round shape", etc. The prompt-mixing technique allows the model to generate diverse shape choices for the object of interest.
- The paper also proposes two localization techniques that use the self-attention and cross-attention layers of the diffusion model to identify and manipulate the region of interest in the image. The first technique uses a mask-based approach that computes a soft mask from the self-attention weights and multiplies it with the cross-attention weights. The mask indicates which pixels in the image are relevant to the object of interest and should be updated by the prompt-mixing operation. The second technique uses a gradient-based approach that computes the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the input image and uses it as a saliency map to guide the prompt-mixing operation. The gradient indicates which pixels in the image are sensitive to the text prompt and should be modified by the prompt-mixing operation. Both techniques aim to localize the image-space operation and avoid affecting other parts of the image that are not related to the object of interest.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a set of text prompts describing different shape variations of an object
# Output: a collection of images depicting the shape variations of the object

# Define a text-to-image diffusion model with self-attention and cross-attention layers
model = DiffusionModel()

# Initialize a noisy input image
image = torch.randn(3, 256, 256)

# Loop over the denoising steps
for t in range(T):

  # Randomly select a prompt from the set of prompts
  prompt = random.choice(prompts)

  # Compute the self-attention weights for the image
  self_attention = model.self_attention(image)

  # Compute the cross-attention weights for the image and the prompt
  cross_attention = model.cross_attention(image, prompt)

  # Choose a localization technique: mask-based or gradient-based
  if localization == "mask":

    # Compute a soft mask from the self-attention weights
    mask = softmax(self_attention, dim=-1)

    # Multiply the mask with the cross-attention weights
    attention = mask * cross_attention

  elif localization == "gradient":

    # Compute the cross-entropy loss between the image and the prompt
    loss = cross_entropy(model(image, prompt), prompt)

    # Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the image
    gradient = torch.autograd.grad(loss, image)

    # Normalize and threshold the gradient to get a saliency map
    saliency = torch.clamp(gradient / gradient.max(), min=0.5)

    # Multiply the saliency map with the cross-attention weights
    attention = saliency * cross_attention

  # Update the image by applying the prompt-mixing operation with the attention weights
  image = model.prompt_mixing(image, prompt, attention)

# Return the collection of images generated at each denoising step
return images
```
