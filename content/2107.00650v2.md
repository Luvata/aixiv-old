Here is a summary of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2 in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces CLIP-It, a language-guided multimodal transformer for generic and query-focused video summarization.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing video summarization methods, which either do not exploit available language models or do not allow users to customize the summary using natural language queries.
- **How**: The paper proposes to score frames in a video based on their importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense video caption (for generic summarization). The paper also extends the model to the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. The paper evaluates the model on three video summarization datasets and shows that it outperforms baselines and prior work by a significant margin.

The summary is based on the abstract and introduction of the paper[^1^][1]. You can read the full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2

According to the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2, the main contributions are:

- **A single framework for both generic and query-focused video summarization**: The paper introduces CLIP-It, a language-guided multimodal transformer that can generate summaries based on either a user-defined query or an automatically generated dense video caption.
- **A language model as an effective prior for saliency**: The paper leverages the pretrained CLIP model [^1^][2] to encode both the video frames and the text queries/captions, and uses a contrastive loss to align them before fusing them through cross-modal attention.
- **An extension to the unsupervised setting**: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning scheme that does not require ground-truth summaries, but instead uses the dense video captions as pseudo-labels and optimizes a reconstruction loss.
- **A comprehensive evaluation on three datasets**: The paper evaluates the model on two standard video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and one query-focused video summarization dataset (QFVS), and shows that it outperforms baselines and prior work by a significant margin, especially in the transfer setting.

The contributions are summarized from Section 1.3 of the paper[^2^][1]. You can read the full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2


## Method Summary

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2:

- **Overview**: The paper proposes a language-guided multimodal transformer that takes as input a video and a text query/caption, and outputs a score for each frame in the video indicating its importance for the summary. The model consists of three main components: a video encoder, a text encoder, and a multimodal fusion module.
- **Video encoder**: The paper uses the pretrained CLIP model [^1^][2] to encode each frame in the video as a 512-dimensional vector. The paper also applies temporal convolutions to capture the temporal context of each frame.
- **Text encoder**: The paper also uses the pretrained CLIP model to encode the text query/caption as a 512-dimensional vector. The paper uses either a user-defined query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense video caption (for generic summarization) as the text input.
- **Multimodal fusion module**: The paper uses a contrastive loss to align the video and text representations before fusing them through cross-modal attention. The paper computes the similarity between each frame and the text input, and compares it with the similarity between other frames and the text input. The paper also computes the self-attention between frames to capture their relative importance. The paper then combines these two attention scores to obtain a final score for each frame, which is used to select the keyframes for the summary.

The summary is based on Section 3 of the paper[^2^][1]. You can read the full paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00650v2
