Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents a method for multimodal image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models and a small module called multimodal conditioning module (MCM).
- **Why**: The paper aims to enable user control over the spatial layout and content of the generated images using 2D modalities (such as segmentation maps or sketches) that were not seen by the diffusion model during training. The paper also aims to reduce the computational cost and data requirement of training multimodal synthesis models from scratch or fine-tuning them.
- **How**: The paper trains a lightweight modulation network that takes the 2D modality as input and produces modulation parameters that are used to adjust the diffusion model's predictions during sampling. The paper keeps the diffusion model's parameters frozen and only trains the modulation network using a limited number of training examples. The paper evaluates the method on unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models and shows improved control and alignment over the generated images.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel method for multimodal image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models and a small module called multimodal conditioning module (MCM) that modulates the diffusion model's predictions during sampling using 2D modalities.**
- **A demonstration that MCM enables user control over the spatial layout and content of the generated images using segmentation maps or sketches as conditioning modalities, without requiring any updates to the diffusion model's parameters.**
- **A comprehensive evaluation of MCM on unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models, showing improved control and alignment over the generated images and their quality and diversity compared to existing methods.**

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces the concept of multimodal conditioning modules (MCM), which are small networks that take a 2D modality (such as a segmentation map or a sketch) as input and produce modulation parameters that are used to adjust the diffusion model's predictions during sampling.
- The paper describes how MCM works with different types of diffusion models, such as unconditional, text-conditional, and latent diffusion models. The paper also explains how MCM handles different types of 2D modalities, such as hard or soft segmentation maps and sketches with varying levels of detail.
- The paper presents the training procedure for MCM, which involves minimizing a reconstruction loss between the generated image and the ground truth image. The paper also discusses some implementation details, such as the choice of modulation function, the number of modulation layers, and the data augmentation techniques.
- The paper provides some ablation studies and qualitative results to show the effectiveness of MCM on various multimodal synthesis tasks, such as generating images from text and segmentation maps, text and sketches, or sketches only. The paper also compares MCM with existing methods that use fine-tuning or training from scratch.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
# Define a diffusion model D and a multimodal conditioning module M
D = PretrainedDiffusionModel()
M = MultimodalConditioningModule()

# Define a 2D modality X and an optional text T
X = SegmentationMap() or Sketch()
T = Text() or None

# Define the number of diffusion steps N

# Sample a noise image Z from a Gaussian distribution
Z = sample_noise()

# Initialize the modulation parameters P to ones

# Loop over the diffusion steps from N to 1
for t in range(N, 0, -1):

  # Compute the mean and variance of the reverse diffusion process
  mean, var = D.reverse(Z, t, T)

  # Modulate the mean and variance using the modulation parameters P
  mean = mean * P
