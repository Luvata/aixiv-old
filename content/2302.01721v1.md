Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents TEXTure, a novel method for text-guided generation, editing, and transfer of textures for 3D shapes.
- **Why**: The paper aims to close the gap between 2D image generation and 3D texturing, and to enable users to easily create, modify, and reuse realistic textures for 3D models using natural language or scribbles.
- **How**: The paper leverages a pretrained depth-to-image diffusion model, TEXTure applies an iterative scheme that paints a 3D model from different viewpoints. To avoid inconsistencies and seams in the generated textures, the paper introduces a trimap partitioning of the rendered image into three progression states, and a novel elaborated diffusion sampling process that uses this trimap representation. The paper also shows how to transfer the generated texture maps to new 3D geometries without requiring explicit surface-to-surface mapping, as well as extract semantic textures from a set of images without requiring any explicit reconstruction. Finally, the paper shows how to edit and refine existing textures using either a text prompt or user-provided scribbles. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of TEXTure through extensive evaluation and comparisons with existing methods.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the **pretrained depth-to-image diffusion model** that is used as the backbone of TEXTure. The model takes a depth map and a text prompt as inputs, and generates a realistic image that matches the text description. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of depth-image pairs with captions, and can handle diverse scenes and objects.
- The paper then describes the **iterative scheme** that paints a 3D model from different viewpoints using the diffusion model. The scheme consists of three steps: rendering, sampling, and blending. In the rendering step, the 3D model is projected onto a 2D plane from a random viewpoint, and a depth map is obtained. In the sampling step, the depth map and a text prompt are fed into the diffusion model to generate a textured image. In the blending step, the textured image is mapped back onto the 3D model and blended with the previous textures using alpha compositing. The scheme repeats these steps until all the visible parts of the 3D model are textured.
- The paper then presents the **trimap partitioning** and the **elaborated diffusion sampling** techniques that enable seamless texturing of 3D models from different viewpoints. The trimap partitioning divides the rendered image into three regions: foreground, background, and unknown. The foreground region contains pixels that are already textured by previous iterations, and should not be changed. The background region contains pixels that are outside the 3D model, and should be ignored. The unknown region contains pixels that need to be textured by the current iteration, and should be sampled from the diffusion model. The elaborated diffusion sampling modifies the sampling process of the diffusion model to use the trimap as an additional input, and to generate consistent textures for the unknown region while preserving the foreground region. The paper also introduces a confidence map that measures how confident the diffusion model is about each pixel, and uses it to adjust the alpha values for blending.
- The paper then shows how to **transfer** the generated texture maps to new 3D geometries without requiring explicit surface-to-surface mapping. The paper proposes to use a neural renderer that takes a 3D shape and a texture map as inputs, and renders an image from a given viewpoint. The paper then uses an inverse rendering technique that optimizes for a new texture map that minimizes the difference between the rendered image and a target image. The paper demonstrates that this technique can transfer textures across different shapes and categories, as well as extract semantic textures from a set of images without requiring any explicit reconstruction.
- Finally, the paper shows how to **edit** and **refine** existing textures using either a text prompt or user-provided scribbles. The paper extends the trimap partitioning and elaborated diffusion sampling techniques to handle these cases. For text editing, the paper uses a new text prompt as an input to the diffusion model, and updates only the unknown region according to the new text description. For scribble editing, the paper uses user-provided scribbles as an input to the diffusion model, and updates only the scribbled region according to the user's intention. The paper demonstrates that these techniques can modify various aspects of textures such as color, shape, pattern, style, etc., while preserving other details.
