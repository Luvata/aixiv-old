Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the objects. The model uses unsupervised large text corpora as the only source of knowledge about the unseen categories.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problem of zero-shot learning, which is the ability to classify instances of an unseen visual class. This is useful for many situations where there are many categories without labeled data or new categories are introduced frequently.
- **How**: The paper proposes a two-step approach. First, it maps images into a semantic space of words that is learned by a neural network model from text corpora. Second, it uses an outlier detection probability to determine whether a new image is on the manifold of known categories or not. If the image is of a known category, a standard classifier is used. If the image is of an unknown category, the model uses the semantic word vectors to find the closest word to the image representation.

The paper claims the following contributions[^1^][1]:

- A novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the objects, using only unsupervised large text corpora as the source of knowledge.
- A new image mapping technique that projects images into a semantic space of words learned by a neural network model from text corpora, without requiring any manually defined semantic features for either words or images.
- An outlier detection probability that determines whether a new image is on the manifold of known categories or not, and uses two separate recognition models accordingly.
- State of the art performance on classes that have thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes, evaluated on four standard datasets.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][2]:

- The paper describes a multi-modal zero-shot model that consists of three components: an image mapping function, an outlier detection probability, and a recognition model.
- The image mapping function projects images into a semantic space of words that is learned by a neural network model from text corpora. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features and a recursive neural network (RNN) to learn word vectors. The image features and word vectors are then aligned using a linear transformation matrix that is learned by minimizing the Euclidean distance between them.
- The outlier detection probability determines whether a new image is on the manifold of known categories or not, based on the distance between the image representation and the closest word vector in the semantic space. The probability is computed using a logistic regression model that is trained on a set of positive and negative examples.
- The recognition model uses two separate classifiers for seen and unseen classes. For seen classes, the model uses a softmax classifier that is trained on the image features and word vectors of the training images. For unseen classes, the model uses a nearest neighbor classifier that finds the closest word vector to the image representation in the semantic space.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Define the image mapping function
def image_mapping(image):
  # Extract image features using a CNN
  image_features = CNN(image)
  # Project image features into the semantic space using a linear transformation matrix
  image_representation = W * image_features
  return image_representation

# Define the outlier detection probability
def outlier_detection(image_representation):
  # Find the closest word vector to the image representation in the semantic space
  closest_word_vector = min(word_vectors, key=lambda w: distance(w, image_representation))
  # Compute the distance between the image representation and the closest word vector
  distance = distance(image_representation, closest_word_vector)
  # Compute the probability of being an outlier using a logistic regression model
  probability = logistic_regression(distance)
  return probability

# Define the recognition model
def recognition_model(image):
  # Map the image into the semantic space
  image_representation = image_mapping(image)
  # Compute the outlier detection probability
  probability = outlier_detection(image_representation)
  # If the probability is below a threshold, use the softmax classifier for seen classes
  if probability < threshold:
    # Predict the class label using the softmax classifier
    class_label = softmax_classifier(image_features, word_vectors)
  # Else, use the nearest neighbor classifier for unseen classes
  else:
    # Find the closest word vector to the image representation in the semantic space
    closest_word_vector = min(word_vectors, key=lambda w: distance(w, image_representation))
    # Predict the class label as the word associated with the closest word vector
    class_label = word(closest_word_vector)
  return class_label
```
