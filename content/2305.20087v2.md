Here is a summary of the paper based on the abstract[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a Vision-Language learning algorithm called TL;DR, which compresses large-scale Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) datasets into smaller, high-quality sets.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the problems of severe image-text misalignment and high redundancy in the widely-used large-scale VLP datasets, which lead to more training cost and storage overhead, and lower performance.
- **How**: The paper develops a codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner to select representative samples from the large VLP datasets, and generates new captions to complement the original ones for the selected samples, mitigating the text-image misalignment problem while maintaining uniqueness. The paper shows that VLP models trained on the compressed datasets can perform similar or even better results than those trained on the full-scale datasets.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper proposes **TL;DR**, a novel Vision-Language learning algorithm that can compress large-scale VLP datasets into smaller, high-quality sets by selecting representative samples and generating new captions for them.
- The paper develops a **codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner** that can efficiently select samples with high diversity and low redundancy, and generate captions that are complementary to the original ones and aligned with the image content.
- The paper conducts **extensive experiments** with three popular VLP models over seven downstream tasks, and shows that TL;DR can achieve similar or even better performance than training on the full-scale datasets, while significantly reducing the training cost and storage overhead.

Here is a summary of the method section based on the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper presents the **TL;DR** algorithm, which consists of two major steps: **sample selection** and **caption generation**.
- In the sample selection step, the paper uses a **codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner** to encode each image-text pair into a code vector, and then clusters the code vectors into different groups using **k-means**. The paper selects one representative sample from each group based on the **distance** to the cluster center and the **diversity** to other samples.
- In the caption generation step, the paper uses the same codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner to generate a new caption for each selected sample, which is **complementary** to the original caption and **aligned** with the image content. The paper uses a **masking strategy** to encourage the model to generate new words that are not in the original caption, and a **ranking strategy** to select the best caption among multiple candidates based on the **relevance**, **uniqueness**, and **fluency** scores.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for the paper:

```python
# Input: a large-scale VLP dataset D
# Output: a compressed VLP dataset C
# Hyperparameters: k (number of clusters), n (number of caption candidates), alpha, beta, gamma (ranking weights)

# Step 1: Sample selection
# Initialize an empty set C
# Train a codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner M on D
# Encode each image-text pair (x,y) in D into a code vector z using M
# Cluster the code vectors z into k groups using k-means
# For each group i:
  # Compute the cluster center c_i as the mean of the code vectors in the group
  # Compute the distance d_j for each sample j in the group as the L2 norm of z_j - c_i
  # Compute the diversity s_j for each sample j in the group as the number of unique words in y_j
  # Select the sample j* that has the smallest d_j and the largest s_j in the group
  # Add (x_j*, y_j*) to C

# Step 2: Caption generation
# For each sample (x,y) in C:
  # Generate n new captions y'_1, ..., y'_n for x using M with a masking strategy
  # For each caption y'_i:
    # Compute the relevance score r_i as the cosine similarity of z and z'_i, where z'_i is the code vector of (x, y'_i)
    # Compute the uniqueness score u_i as the Jaccard distance of y and y'_i
    # Compute the fluency score f_i as the log-likelihood of y'_i given x and M
    # Compute the ranking score q_i as alpha * r_i + beta * u_i + gamma * f_i
  # Select the caption y'_* that has the highest q_i among all candidates
  # Replace y with y'_* in C

# Return C
```

import numpy as np
import sklearn.cluster
import nltk

# Define hyperparameters
k = 100 # number of clusters
n = 5 # number of caption candidates
alpha = 0.5 # weight for relevance score
beta = 0.3 # weight for uniqueness score
gamma = 0.2 # weight for fluency score
mask_prob = 0.3 # probability of masking a word in the original caption

# Load the large-scale VLP dataset D
D = load_dataset("cc3m")

# Initialize an empty set C
C = set()

# Train a codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner M on D
M = train_model(D)

# Encode each image-text pair (x,y) in D into a code vector z using M
Z = []
for (x,y) in D:
  z = M.encode(x,y)
  Z.append(z)

# Cluster the code vectors Z into k groups using k-means
kmeans = sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=k)
kmeans.fit(Z)
labels = kmeans.labels_
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_

# For each group i:
for i in range(k):
  # Get the samples in the group
  group = [D[j] for j in range(len(D)) if labels[j] == i]
  # Compute the cluster center c_i as the mean of the code vectors in the group
  c_i = centers[i]
  # Compute the distance d_j for each sample j in the group as the L2 norm of z_j - c_i
  d_j = [torch.norm(Z[j] - c_i) for j in range(len(D)) if labels[j] == i]
  # Compute the diversity s_j for each sample j in the group as the number of unique words in y_j
  s_j = [len(set(nltk.word_tokenize(D[j][1]))) for j in range(len(D)) if labels[j] == i]
  # Select the sample j* that has the smallest d_j and the largest s_j in the group
  j_star = np.argmin(d_j + np.max(s_j) - s_j)
  # Add (x_j*, y_j*) to C
  C.add(group[j_star])

# Step 2: Caption generation
# For each sample (x,y) in C:
for (x,y) in C:
  # Generate n new captions y'_1, ..., y'_n for x using M with a masking strategy
  y_prime = []
  for i in range(n):
    # Mask some words in y with a special token [MASK] with probability mask_prob
    y_masked = ""
    for word in nltk.word_tokenize(y):
      if np.random.rand() < mask_prob:
        y_masked += "[MASK] "
      else:
        y_masked += word + " "
    # Generate a new caption y'_i for x using M conditioned on y_masked
    y_prime_i = M.generate(x, y_masked)
    y_prime.append(y_prime_i)
  
  # For each caption y'_i:
  q_i = []
  for i in range(n):
    # Compute the relevance score r_i as the cosine similarity of z and z'_i, where z'_i is the code vector of (x, y'_i)
    z_prime_i = M.encode(x, y_prime[i])
    r_i = torch.cosine_similarity(z, z_prime_i)
    # Compute the uniqueness score u_i as the Jaccard distance of y and y'_i
    u_i = nltk.jaccard_distance(set(nltk.word_tokenize(y)), set(nltk.word_tokenize(y_prime[i])))
    # Compute the fluency score f_i as the log-likelihood of y'_i given x and M
    f_i = M.log_likelihood(x, y_prime[i])
    # Compute the ranking score q_i as alpha * r_i + beta * u_i + gamma * f_i
    q_i.append(alpha * r_i + beta * u_i + gamma * f_i)
  
  # Select the caption y'_* that has the highest q_i among all candidates
  y_star = y_prime[np.argmax(q_i)]
  
  # Replace y with y'_* in C
  C.remove((x,y))
  C.add((x,y_star))
