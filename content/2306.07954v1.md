Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel zero-shot text-guided video-to-video translation framework based on pre-trained image diffusion model[^1^][1].
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring temporal consistency across video frames when applying existing image diffusion models to video domain[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper's framework includes two parts: key frame translation and full video translation. The first part uses an adapted diffusion model to generate key frames, with hierarchical cross-frame constraints applied to enforce coherence in shapes, textures and colors. The second part propagates the key frames to other frames with temporal-aware patch matching and frame blending[^1^][1]. The paper also shows how the framework can leverage existing image diffusion techniques such as LoRA and ControlNet for more customized and spatially-guided video generation[^1^][1].

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel zero-shot text-guided video-to-video translation framework** that adapts pre-trained image diffusion models to video domain without re-training or optimization.
- **An adapted diffusion model for key frame translation** that incorporates hierarchical cross-frame constraints to enforce coherence in shapes, textures and colors across key frames.
- **A temporal-aware patch matching and frame blending method for full video translation** that propagates the key frames to other frames and achieves global style and local texture temporal consistency.
- **A compatibility with existing image diffusion techniques** such as LoRA and ControlNet that allows the framework to customize a specific subject or introduce extra spatial guidance for video generation.
- **Extensive experimental results** that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over existing methods in rendering high-quality and temporally-coherent videos.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper's method consists of two parts: **key frame translation** and **full video translation**[^1^][1].
- For key frame translation, the paper adapts a pre-trained image diffusion model to generate key frames from text descriptions. The paper introduces **hierarchical cross-frame constraints** to enforce coherence in shapes, textures and colors across key frames. The paper also shows how to use existing image diffusion techniques such as LoRA and ControlNet to customize a specific subject or introduce extra spatial guidance for key frame generation[^1^][1].
- For full video translation, the paper proposes a **temporal-aware patch matching and frame blending** method to propagate the key frames to other frames. The paper uses optical flow and patch matching to align the key frames with the input frames, and then blends them with a weighted average. The paper also applies a temporal smoothing filter to reduce flickering[^1^][1].
- The paper evaluates the proposed method on several video datasets and compares it with existing methods in terms of visual quality, temporal consistency, diversity and user preference[^1^][1].

# Full video translation
# Initialize the translated video W with the same length and resolution as V
W = initialize_video(V)
# For each frame in V
for i in range(len(V)):
  # Find the nearest key frame in K'
  j = find_nearest_key_frame(i, K')
  # Compute the optical flow between V[i] and K[j]
