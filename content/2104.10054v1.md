Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new method for text-video retrieval called T2VLAD, which uses global-local sequence alignment to measure cross-modal similarities between natural language descriptions and video contents.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods that only consider the global cross-modal similarity and overlook the local details, or use complex operations that introduce tremendous computation.
- **How**: The paper designs an efficient global-local alignment method that consists of two components: a local alignment component that adaptively aggregates the multi-modal video sequences and text features with a set of shared semantic centers, and computes the local cross-modal similarities within each center; and a global alignment component that provides a global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective, and also provides additional supervision for the optimization of the semantic centers. The paper evaluates the proposed method on three standard text-video retrieval benchmarks and shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by a clear margin[^1^][1].

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- It proposes a novel global-local sequence alignment method for text-video retrieval that enables meticulous local comparison and reduces the computational cost of the interaction between each text-video pair.
- It introduces a global alignment method that provides a global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective, and also provides additional supervision for the optimization of the learnable semantic centers.
- It achieves consistent improvements on three standard text-video retrieval benchmarks and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The method section describes the proposed global-local sequence alignment method for text-video retrieval, which consists of two components: a local alignment component and a global alignment component.
- The local alignment component aims to adaptively aggregate the multi-modal video sequences and text features with a set of shared semantic centers, and compute the local cross-modal similarities within each center. The paper introduces the concept of Text-to-Video VLAD (T2VLAD), which is inspired by the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) . T2VLAD learns a set of semantic centers that are shared by both modalities, and assigns each video or text feature to its nearest center. Then, it computes the residual vectors between the features and their assigned centers, and aggregates them into a compact representation. The paper also proposes a soft assignment scheme that allows each feature to be assigned to multiple centers with different weights, which improves the robustness and diversity of the representation. The paper further applies a self-attention mechanism  to enhance the feature aggregation process by capturing the long-range dependencies among the features. The paper finally computes the local cross-modal similarities by dot-product between the video and text T2VLAD representations within each center.
- The global alignment component aims to provide a global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective, and also provide additional supervision for the optimization of the learnable semantic centers. The paper proposes a global alignment method that aggregates the video features across all frames into a single vector, and computes its similarity with the text feature by dot-product. The paper also uses this global aggregated video feature as an auxiliary supervision signal for learning the semantic centers, by minimizing its distance to the corresponding text feature. The paper argues that this supervision helps to align the semantic centers with the global cross-modal information, and improves the retrieval performance.
- The paper combines the local and global alignment components into a unified framework, and optimizes it with a max-margin ranking loss  that encourages higher similarities between matched text-video pairs than unmatched ones. The paper also introduces some implementation details such as feature extraction, dimension reduction, normalization, and training strategies.

```python
# Input: a text-video pair (t, v)
# Output: a cross-modal similarity score s

# Extract video features v_i and text feature t from the input pair
v_i = extract_video_features(v)
