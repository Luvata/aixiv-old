Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes Make-A-Video, an approach for generating videos from text without using paired text-video data.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing Text-to-Video (T2V) models that require large amounts of paired text-video data, which are scarce and expensive to collect. The paper also aims to leverage the recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) models that can generate diverse and realistic images from text.
- **How**: The paper builds on T2I models with novel spatial-temporal modules that learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. The paper decomposes the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximates them in space and time. The paper also designs a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models. The paper evaluates the proposed approach on various datasets and metrics and shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art in T2V generation. [^1^][1]

The paper claims the following contributions:

- **A novel approach for text-to-video generation without text-video data**: The paper proposes Make-A-Video, which leverages text-to-image models and unsupervised video learning to generate videos from text without using paired text-video data. The paper shows that this approach can generate diverse and realistic videos that are faithful to the input text.
- **A novel design of spatial-temporal modules for video generation**: The paper introduces a novel way of decomposing the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximating them in space and time. The paper also introduces a novel video decoder that can generate videos with variable frame rates and lengths.
- **A novel spatial temporal pipeline for high resolution and frame rate video generation**: The paper designs a spatial temporal pipeline that consists of a video decoder, an interpolation model and two super resolution models. The paper shows that this pipeline can generate high resolution and frame rate videos that can enable various applications besides text-to-video generation.
- **A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach**: The paper evaluates the proposed approach on various datasets and metrics, including human evaluation. The paper shows that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in text-to-video generation in all aspects. [^1^][1]

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- **The paper builds on a text-to-image model called DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021)**: The paper uses DALL-E as the backbone for text-to-video generation, since it can generate diverse and realistic images from text. The paper modifies DALL-E by adding spatial-temporal modules that enable video generation.
- **The paper introduces a novel way of decomposing the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximating them in space and time**: The paper proposes a method called Temporal Decomposition (TD) that reduces the memory and computation cost of applying U-Net and attention across time. The paper shows that TD can achieve comparable or better results than full temporal U-Net and attention with much less resources.
- **The paper introduces a novel video decoder that can generate videos with variable frame rates and lengths**: The paper proposes a method called Frame Rate Control (FRC) that allows the video decoder to generate videos with different frame rates and lengths depending on the input text. The paper shows that FRC can generate videos that match the desired motion speed and duration specified by the text.
- **The paper designs a spatial temporal pipeline that consists of a video decoder, an interpolation model and two super resolution models**: The paper proposes a method called Spatial Temporal Pipeline (STP) that can generate high resolution and frame rate videos from low resolution and frame rate videos. The paper shows that STP can improve the visual quality and realism of the generated videos. [^1^][1] [^2^][2]
