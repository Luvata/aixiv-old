## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method to improve Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) by learning a gate for each ViT block to adjust its intervention into the prompt tokens[^1^][1].
- **Why**: VPT is an effective tuning method for adapting pretrained ViTs to downstream tasks, but it often underperforms with self-supervised ones. The paper argues that the effectiveness of VPT depends on the optimal location of blocks for the insertion of prompt tokens, which varies across different self-supervised models and tasks[^1^][1].
- **How**: The paper introduces a gated prompt tuning (GPT) method that learns a gate for each ViT block to control its influence on the prompt tokens. The gate is computed by a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function, and it is applied element-wise to the output of each block before it is added to the prompt tokens. The paper evaluates GPT on several image classification and semantic segmentation tasks using different self-supervised ViTs, and shows that GPT outperforms VPT variants and other baselines[^1^][1].


## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- They propose a simple yet effective method to improve VPT for self-supervised ViTs by learning a gate for each ViT block to adjust its intervention into the prompt tokens.
- They empirically show that the optimal location of blocks for the insertion of prompt tokens varies across different self-supervised models and tasks, and that their method can automatically adapt to it.
- They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several image classification and semantic segmentation tasks using different self-supervised ViTs, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper introduces a gated prompt tuning (GPT) method that learns a gate for each ViT block to control its influence on the prompt tokens[^1^][1].
- The paper defines the prompt tokens as extra learnable tokens that are concatenated with the image patches and the class token as the input of the ViT[^1^][1].
- The paper describes how the gate is computed by a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function, and how it is applied element-wise to the output of each block before it is added to the prompt tokens[^1^][1].
- The paper explains how the gate allows the prompt tokens to be selectively influenced by blocks that require steering for task adaptation, and how it reduces the computational cost and memory usage compared to VPT[^1^][1].
- The paper details how they implement GPT for different self-supervised ViTs and downstream tasks, such as image classification and semantic segmentation[^1^][1].

Here is a possible pseudo code for the paper:

```python
# Load a pretrained self-supervised ViT model
model = load_pretrained_vit()

# Initialize prompt tokens randomly
prompt_tokens = init_prompt_tokens()

# Define a linear layer with sigmoid activation for each ViT block
gates = [LinearLayer(sigmoid) for block in model.blocks]

# Define a loss function for the downstream task
loss_fn = define_loss_fn()

# Define an optimizer for the prompt tokens and the gates
optimizer = define_optimizer(prompt_tokens, gates)

# Loop over the training data
for batch in train_data:

  # Get the image patches and the labels
  image_patches, labels = batch

  # Concatenate the image patches, the class token and the prompt tokens
  input_tokens = concat(image_patches, model.class_token, prompt_tokens)

  # Pass the input tokens through the ViT model
  output_tokens = model(input_tokens)

  # Loop over the ViT blocks
  for i, block in enumerate(model.blocks):

    # Get the output of the current block
    block_output = block.output

    # Apply the gate to the block output
    gated_output = gates[i](block_output) * block_output

    # Add the gated output to the prompt tokens
    prompt_tokens = prompt_tokens + gated_output

  # Get the final output token for the class prediction
  class_token = output_tokens[0]

  # Compute the loss with respect to the labels
  loss = loss_fn(class_token, labels)

  # Update the prompt tokens and the gates using backpropagation
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
