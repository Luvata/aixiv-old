Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper explores how to use pseudolabels, i.e., heuristic labels for unlabeled data, to enhance CLIP via prompt tuning. Prompt tuning is an approach to efficiently enhance vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP by learning inputs to the model.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limited availability of labeled data for fine-tuning VLMs like CLIP to downstream tasks. The paper also aims to investigate different learning paradigms, such as semi-supervised, transductive zero-shot, and unsupervised learning, and different prompt modalities, such as textual or visual prompts, for prompt tuning with pseudolabels.
- **How**: The paper uses CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to generate pseudolabels for unlabeled data without task-specific training. The paper then uses these pseudolabels as a source of supervision for prompt tuning. The paper develops versatile training strategies that are applicable across learning paradigms and prompt modalities. The paper evaluates these strategies on image classification tasks where CLIP exhibits limitations and compares them with conventional pseudolabeling and baseline methods.

According to the paper at [^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper presents a **unified view** of different learning paradigms for prompt tuning with pseudolabels, such as semi-supervised, transductive zero-shot, and unsupervised learning, and shows that they can all be seen as optimizing the same loss function.
- The paper develops **versatile training strategies** that are applicable across learning paradigms and prompt modalities, such as textual or visual prompts. The paper introduces **iterative prompt tuning** strategies that refine pseudolabels over multiple rounds of training.
- The paper provides **empirical evidence** of the effectiveness of prompt tuning with pseudolabels on image classification tasks where CLIP exhibits limitations. The paper shows that prompt tuning with pseudolabels consistently improves CLIP accuracy and leads to a more equitable distribution of per-class accuracy than conventional pseudolabeling. The paper also compares prompt tuning with baseline methods and analyzes the impact of different factors on the performance.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper defines the **problem formulation** of prompt tuning with pseudolabels as a minimization of a loss function that depends on the prompt modality, the learning paradigm, and the pseudolabeling strategy.
- The paper introduces the **prompt modalities** of textual prompts (CoPs), visual prompts (VPTs), and multimodal prompts (MPTs), and explains how they are used to generate pseudolabels and optimize prompts.
- The paper describes the **learning paradigms** of semi-supervised learning (SSL), transductive zero-shot learning (TZSL), and unsupervised learning (UL), and shows how they can be unified under the same loss function with different pseudolabeling strategies.
- The paper proposes the **training strategies** of few pseudolabels (FP) and iterative few pseudolabels (IFP), and compares them with conventional pseudolabeling (CP) and baseline methods. The paper also discusses the factors that affect the performance of prompt tuning with pseudolabels, such as data quality, data size, data distribution, and model initialization.
