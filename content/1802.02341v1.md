Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper introduces a technique to detect and filter outliers in multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), a method for data-exploration, dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the robustness of MDS, which is sensitive to outliers and can yield significant errors in the embedding even when only a few outliers are present.
- **How**: The paper uses geometric reasoning to test the validity of triangles formed by three points, and marks a triangle as broken if its triangle inequality does not hold. The paper assumes that unlike inliers, outlier distances tend to break many triangles. The paper then filters out the edges that belong to many broken triangles and applies MDS on the remaining edges. The paper evaluates the performance of the technique on various datasets and distributions of outliers.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel technique to detect and filter outliers in MDS based on geometric reasoning.
- A proof that the technique is effective and leads to a high embedding quality for a reasonable amount of outliers.
- A comparison with state-of-the-art MDS algorithms and other outlier detection methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a technique to detect and filter outliers in MDS based on geometric reasoning.
- The paper treats the distances as a complete graph of N(N-1)/2 edges, each edge associated with its corresponding distance and forming N(N-1)(N-2)/6 triangles with the rest of the N-2 nodes.
- The paper defines a triangle as broken if its triangle inequality does not hold, i.e., if the sum of any two edge lengths is smaller than the third edge length.
- The paper assumes that unlike inliers, outlier distances tend to break many triangles, and thus assigns a score to each edge based on the number of broken triangles it belongs to.
- The paper filters out the edges with high scores and applies MDS on the remaining edges, using either SMACOF or t-SNE as the underlying MDS algorithm.
- The paper also introduces a parameter k to control the number of edges to be filtered out, and suggests a heuristic to choose k based on the distribution of edge scores.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a distance matrix D of size N x N
# Output: an embedding X of size N x d
def robust_mds(D):
  # Construct a complete graph G with N nodes and N(N-1)/2 edges
  G = create_graph(D)
  # Initialize an empty list of edge scores
  scores = []
  # For each edge in G
  for e in G.edges:
    # Count the number of broken triangles that e belongs to
    count = count_broken_triangles(e, G)
    # Append the count to the scores list
    scores.append(count)
  # Sort the scores in descending order
  scores.sort(reverse=True)
  # Choose a parameter k based on the distribution of scores
  k = choose_k(scores)
  # Filter out the top k edges with the highest scores
  G.filter_edges(scores[:k])
  # Apply MDS on the remaining edges using SMACOF or t-SNE
  X = mds(G.edges)
  # Return the embedding X
  return X
