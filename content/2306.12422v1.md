Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes an improved optimization strategy for text-to-3D content creation using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods for text-to-3D content creation, such as low quality, unrealistic appearance, and low diversity of the generated 3D models.
- **How**: The paper shows that the conflict between NeRF optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillation is the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, the paper proposes to prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions, which aligns NeRF optimization with the sampling process of diffusion model. The paper demonstrates that this simple redesign significantly improves text-to-3D content creation with higher quality and diversity.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt T
# Output: a 3D model M that matches T

# Initialize a NeRF model M with random weights
# Initialize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model D
# Initialize a timestep sampling function f with a monotonically non-increasing shape
