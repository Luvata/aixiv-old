According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- **A novel unsupervised approach** to learn and detect distinctive regions on 3D shapes, which does not require any labeled data or prior knowledge of shape categories.
- **A clustering-based nonparametric softmax classifier** with an iterative re-clustering of shapes, which can effectively learn local and global features for distinguishing shapes with respect to a given shape set.
- **An adapted contrastive loss** for enhancing the feature embedding quality and stabilizing the learning process, which can also encourage the network to learn the point distinctiveness on the input shapes.
- **An extensive evaluation** of various aspects of the approach and its applications for distinctiveness-guided shape retrieval, sampling, and view selection in 3D scenes.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a **deep neural network** that takes point sets sampled from 3D shapes as input and outputs distinctive scores for each point, indicating how likely the point belongs to a distinctive region on the shape.
- The network consists of two parts: a **feature extraction module** and a **distinctiveness estimation module**. The feature extraction module uses PointNet++  to learn local and global features for each point. The distinctiveness estimation module uses a clustering-based nonparametric softmax classifier to assign each point to one of the clusters that represent different shapes in the shape set, and then computes the distinctive score based on the cluster assignment probabilities and the cluster sizes.
- To train the network in an unsupervised manner, the paper designs two loss functions: a **clustering loss** and a **contrastive loss**. The clustering loss encourages the network to learn features that can distinguish different shapes in the shape set, while the contrastive loss enhances the feature embedding quality and stabilizes the learning process by minimizing the intra-cluster distances and maximizing the inter-cluster distances. The paper also introduces an iterative re-clustering scheme to update the cluster centers and sizes during training.
- To detect distinctive regions on 3D shapes, the paper applies a threshold on the distinctive scores of the points and then performs region growing and merging to obtain coherent regions. The paper also proposes a refinement step to adjust the region boundaries based on local curvature information.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a set of 3D shapes S and a number of clusters K
# Output: distinctive scores for each point on each shape

# Initialize cluster centers C and sizes N randomly
# Initialize network parameters W
# Repeat until convergence:
  # For each shape s in S:
    # Sample a point set P from s
    # Extract local and global features F for each point in P using PointNet++
    # Compute cluster assignment probabilities Q for each point in P using C and N
    # Compute distinctive scores D for each point in P using Q and N
  # Compute clustering loss L_c using Q and C
  # Compute contrastive loss L_t using F and C
  # Update W by minimizing L_c + L_t
  # Update C and N by re-clustering S using F
# For each shape s in S:
  # Apply a threshold T on D to obtain distinctive points
  # Perform region growing and merging to obtain distinctive regions R
  # Refine region boundaries based on local curvature information
