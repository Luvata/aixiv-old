Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new method for text-to-image synthesis using diffusion models, called eDiff-I. Diffusion models are generative models that start from random noise and gradually refine it into realistic images while conditioning on text prompts.
- **Why**: The paper aims to improve the text alignment and visual quality of text-to-image synthesis, which is a challenging and useful task for various applications. The paper argues that existing diffusion models share the same parameters throughout the generation process, which may not be optimal for capturing the different modes of synthesis (e.g., content generation vs. detail refinement).
- **How**: The paper introduces an ensemble of diffusion models that are specialized for different synthesis stages. The paper trains a single model first, then splits it into multiple models that are fine-tuned for specific stages of the generation process. The paper also trains the model to use different embeddings for conditioning, such as T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. The paper shows that these embeddings lead to different behaviors and capabilities, such as style transfer and paint-with-words.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- A novel method for text-to-image synthesis using an ensemble of diffusion models that are specialized for different synthesis stages, resulting in improved text alignment and visual quality.
- A comprehensive analysis of the effects of different embeddings for conditioning on text-to-image synthesis, showing that CLIP image embedding enables style transfer and paint-with-words capabilities.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the standard benchmark, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- **Background**: The paper reviews the basics of diffusion models and text-to-image synthesis, and introduces the notation and terminology used in the paper.
- **Ensemble of Diffusion Models**: The paper describes how to train an ensemble of diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis, starting from a single model and then splitting it into multiple models that are fine-tuned for different synthesis stages. The paper also explains how to sample from the ensemble using a weighted average of the outputs from each model.
- **Conditioning on Different Embeddings**: The paper discusses how to condition the diffusion models on different embeddings, such as T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. The paper shows that these embeddings have different properties and advantages for text-to-image synthesis, such as semantic alignment, style transfer, and paint-with-words.
- **Paint-with-Words**: The paper presents a technique that enables the user to control the layout of objects in the output image by painting words on a canvas. The paper explains how to generate a mask from the painted words and use it to guide the generation process. The paper also shows some examples of using this technique to create images with complex scenes.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Train a single diffusion model
model = DiffusionModel()
model.train(data, text)

# Split the model into an ensemble of models
models = []
for i in range(num_stages):
  # Copy the model parameters
  model_i = copy(model)
  # Fine-tune the model for a specific stage
  model_i.fine_tune(data, text, stage=i)
  # Add the model to the ensemble
  models.append(model_i)

# Sample from the ensemble of models
def sample(text, image=None):
  # Initialize the noise image
  x = random_noise()
  # Optionally, use a reference image for style transfer
  if image is not None:
    # Encode the image using CLIP image embedding
    image_emb = clip_image_encoder(image)
    # Condition on the image embedding
    text = text + image_emb
  # Optionally, use a canvas for paint-with-words
  if canvas is not None:
    # Generate a mask from the painted words
    mask = generate_mask(canvas, text)
    # Condition on the mask
    text = text + mask
  # Iterate over the synthesis stages in reverse order
  for i in range(num_stages-1, -1, -1):
    # Get the model for the current stage
    model_i = models[i]
    # Predict the denoised image for the current stage
    x_i = model_i.predict(x, text)
    # Weighted average of the current and previous outputs
    x = alpha * x_i + (1 - alpha) * x
  # Return the final output image
  return x
