Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper presents VISPROG, a neuro-symbolic approach to solving complex and compositional visual tasks given natural language instructions.
- **Why**: The paper aims to avoid the need for any task-specific training and to expand the scope of AI systems to serve the long tail of complex tasks that people may wish to perform.
- **How**: The paper uses the in-context learning ability of large language models to generate python-like modular programs, which are then executed to get both the solution and a comprehensive and interpretable rationale. Each line of the generated program may invoke one of several off-the-shelf computer vision models, image processing routines, or python functions to produce intermediate outputs that may be consumed by subsequent parts of the program. The paper demonstrates the flexibility of VISPROG on 4 diverse tasks - compositional visual question answering, zero-shot reasoning on image pairs, factual knowledge object tagging, and language-guided image editing.

- **A demonstration of the generalizability** of the proposed approach to unseen tasks and domains by applying it to a few examples from the COG dataset and the CLEVR dataset.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper proposes a two-stage approach to solve visual tasks given natural language instructions: program generation and program execution.
- **Program generation**: The paper uses a large language model (GPT-3) to generate a python-like modular program from the natural language instruction and the input image(s). The program consists of multiple lines, each of which may invoke one of several modules that perform different operations on the input or intermediate outputs. The paper defines a grammar for the program syntax and a set of modules that cover various computer vision models, image processing routines, and python functions. The paper also uses a few heuristics to filter out invalid or low-quality programs.
- **Program execution**: The paper executes the generated program line by line, using the appropriate module for each line. The paper uses off-the-shelf computer vision models (such as Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, CLIP, etc.) and image processing routines (such as OpenCV, PIL, etc.) to implement the modules. The paper also uses python functions (such as numpy, math, etc.) to perform arithmetic or logical operations. The paper outputs both the final solution and a comprehensive and interpretable rationale that shows the intermediate outputs and explanations for each line of the program.
