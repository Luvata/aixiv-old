## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a technique called **SeedSelect** for text-to-image generation with diffusion models. SeedSelect selects suitable generation seeds in the noise space that can improve the quality and diversity of the generated images, especially for rare or structured concepts.
- **Why**: The paper addresses the problem of unbalanced training data for text-to-image models, which causes them to under-represent concepts from the long tail of the distribution. The paper shows that rare concepts can be correctly generated by using SeedSelect, without retraining the diffusion model.
- **How**: The paper evaluates SeedSelect on three tasks: few-shot semantic data augmentation, hand image correction, and image editing. The paper shows that SeedSelect improves the performance of text-to-image models on all tasks, compared to baseline methods. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of SeedSelect and its relation to data augmentation and contrastive learning.

The paper claims the following contributions[^1^][1]:

- **SeedSelect**: A novel technique for text-to-image generation with diffusion models that selects suitable generation seeds in the noise space based on a similarity metric between the text and the latent code.
- **Few-shot semantic data augmentation**: A new application of text-to-image models for generating semantically correct images for few-shot and long-tail benchmarks, such as CIFAR-FS and ImageNet-LT. The paper shows that SeedSelect improves the classification accuracy of downstream models on both benchmarks.
- **Hand image correction**: A new task of correcting images of hands, which are often distorted by diffusion models due to their complex structure. The paper shows that SeedSelect can generate realistic and diverse images of hands from text descriptions.
- **Image editing**: A new task of editing existing images by changing their text descriptions. The paper shows that SeedSelect can modify images in a controllable and coherent way, such as changing the color, shape, or position of objects.
- **Theoretical analysis**: A theoretical analysis of SeedSelect and its relation to data augmentation and contrastive learning. The paper proves that SeedSelect can increase the effective data size and reduce the gap between the data distribution and the model distribution.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **Text-to-image diffusion models**: The paper uses a diffusion model that consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a denoiser. The encoder maps an image to a latent code, the decoder maps a latent code and a text embedding to an image, and the denoiser predicts the original image from a noisy image. The model is trained by reversing the diffusion process, starting from a pure noise image and gradually adding details until reaching the original image.
- **SeedSelect**: The paper proposes a technique for selecting suitable generation seeds in the noise space for a given text description. The technique consists of two steps: (1) sampling a set of candidate seeds from a prior distribution, and (2) ranking the candidates based on a similarity metric between the text and the latent code. The similarity metric is computed by projecting both the text and the latent code to a common space using a linear layer, and then measuring their cosine similarity. The paper uses the top-ranked seed as the input for the diffusion model to generate an image.
- **Few-shot semantic data augmentation**: The paper applies SeedSelect to generate semantically correct images for few-shot and long-tail benchmarks, such as CIFAR-FS and ImageNet-LT. The paper uses a text-to-image model pretrained on ImageNet-21K as the base model, and then fine-tunes it on a small subset of images from the target dataset. The paper then uses SeedSelect to generate additional images for each class based on their textual descriptions. The paper trains a classifier on the augmented data and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.
- **Hand image correction**: The paper applies SeedSelect to correct images of hands, which are often distorted by diffusion models due to their complex structure. The paper uses a text-to-image model pretrained on ImageNet-21K as the base model, and then fine-tunes it on a hand dataset. The paper then uses SeedSelect to generate realistic and diverse images of hands from text descriptions, such as "a hand with five fingers" or "a hand holding an apple". The paper evaluates the quality of the generated images using human judgments and quantitative metrics.
- **Image editing**: The paper applies SeedSelect to edit existing images by changing their text descriptions. The paper uses a text-to-image model pretrained on ImageNet-21K as the base model, and then fine-tunes it on an image editing dataset. The paper then uses SeedSelect to modify images in a controllable and coherent way, such as changing the color, shape, or position of objects. The paper evaluates the quality of the edited images using human judgments and quantitative metrics.
