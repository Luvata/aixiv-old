Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new zero-shot framework called Fine-Grained Visual Prompting (FGVP) that leverages pixel-level annotations from a generalist segmentation model to improve the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in instance-level tasks such as referring expression comprehension and part detection.
- **Why**: The paper argues that existing visual prompting techniques, such as using colorful boxes or circles, are sub-optimal for instance-level tasks because they include irrelevant and noisy pixels that distract the VLMs from focusing on the objects of interest. The paper also claims that visual prompting designs are rarely explored compared to language prompting, and there is a need for more fine-grained markings that can highlight the target regions more precisely.
- **How**: The paper explores various fine-grained visual prompting designs, such as segmentation masks and their variations, and evaluates their effectiveness on zero-shot comprehension of referring expressions on three benchmarks: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg. The paper finds that a simple strategy of blurring outside the target mask, called the Blur Reverse Mask, achieves the best results among all the visual prompting techniques. The paper also conducts experiments on part detection on the PACO dataset and shows that FGVP outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper introduces a new zero-shot framework that leverages pixel-level annotations from a generalist segmentation model for fine-grained visual prompting. The generalist segmentation model is a pre-trained model that can segment any object in an image using natural language queries. The paper uses the model from  as an example.
- The paper explores various fine-grained visual prompting designs, such as segmentation masks and their variations. The paper defines a visual prompt as a pair of an image and a text query, and a visual prompting design as a function that modifies the image based on the text query and the segmentation mask. The paper considers four types of visual prompting designs: Mask, Reverse Mask, Blur Mask, and Blur Reverse Mask. The paper also considers different ways of applying colors to the masks, such as random colors, fixed colors, or colors based on the text query.
- The paper evaluates the effectiveness of different visual prompting designs on zero-shot comprehension of referring expressions on three benchmarks: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg. The paper uses CLIP  as the vision-language model and follows the zero-shot setting from . The paper compares FGVP with existing methods that use coarse visual cues such as colorful boxes or circles  .
- The paper also conducts experiments on part detection on the PACO dataset , which contains images of animals with annotated parts.
