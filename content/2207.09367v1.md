Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- What: The paper proposes a method called **cycle encoding** for improving the reconstruction and editability of images inverted by a StyleGAN encoder.
- Why: The paper aims to address the tradeoff between distortion and editability in GAN inversion, which is the task of finding a latent code that can generate an input image using a pre-trained GAN generator.
- How: The paper uses a two-step approach that first trains an encoder to map an input image to a pivot code in the W space, which has high editability, and then tunes the generator to map the pivot code to the input image with low distortion. The encoder is trained in a cycle scheme that alternates between the W and W+ spaces, which are different latent spaces of StyleGAN. The paper also refines the pivot code with an optimization-based method that introduces a regularization term to reduce the degradation in editability. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several datasets and compares it with state-of-the-art methods.

## Main Contributions

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A novel method for GAN inversion that leverages cycle encoding to obtain a high-quality pivot code that balances distortion and editability.
- A refinement strategy for the pivot code that uses a regularization term to preserve the editability while reducing the distortion.
- Extensive experiments on various datasets and tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.

## Method Summary

The method section of the paper consists of four subsections:

- Preliminaries: This subsection introduces the background and notation of StyleGAN and GAN inversion, and defines the problem of finding a pivot code that minimizes distortion and maximizes editability.
- Cycle Encoding: This subsection presents the main idea of cycle encoding, which is to train an encoder in a cycle scheme that alternates between the W and W+ spaces. The encoder learns to map an input image to a pivot code in the W space, which has high editability, and then map the pivot code back to the input image in the W+ space, which has low distortion. The encoder is trained with a cycle consistency loss and an identity preservation loss.
- Pivot Code Refinement: This subsection describes the refinement strategy for the pivot code, which is to optimize it with a regularization term that penalizes the deviation from the original pivot code. The refinement aims to reduce the distortion while preserving the editability of the pivot code.
- Generator Tuning: This subsection explains how to tune the generator to match the input image with the refined pivot code. The tuning is done by updating the affine transformation layers of StyleGAN with a perceptual loss and an adversarial loss. The tuning ensures that the input image can be accurately reconstructed by the generator with the refined pivot code.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: an image x and a pre-trained StyleGAN generator G
# Output: a refined pivot code w* and a tuned generator G*

# Step 1: Cycle Encoding
# Initialize an encoder E that maps x to w in W space and w to x' in W+ space
# Train E with cycle consistency loss and identity preservation loss
# Obtain the pivot code w = E(x)

# Step 2: Pivot Code Refinement
# Initialize a refinement function R that maps w to w' in W space
# Optimize R with perceptual loss and regularization loss
# Obtain the refined pivot code w' = R(w)

# Step 3: Generator Tuning
# Initialize a tuning function T that updates the affine layers of G
# Optimize T with perceptual loss and adversarial loss
# Obtain the tuned generator G' = T(G)

# Return w' and G'
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# Input: an image x and a pre-trained StyleGAN generator G
# Output: a refined pivot code w* and a tuned generator G*

# Step 1: Cycle Encoding
# Initialize an encoder E that consists of two sub-encoders: E_W and E_W+
# E_W maps x to w in W space and E_W+ maps w to x' in W+ space
# Define the cycle consistency loss L_cycle as the L1 distance between x and x'
# Define the identity preservation loss L_id as the cosine similarity between the feature maps of x and x' extracted by a pre-trained VGG network
# Define the total loss L_E as the weighted sum of L_cycle and L_id
# Train E by minimizing L_E with stochastic gradient descent
# Obtain the pivot code w = E_W(x)

# Step 2: Pivot Code Refinement
# Initialize a refinement function R that consists of a fully connected layer followed by a LeakyReLU activation
# R maps w to w' in W space with a small perturbation
# Define the perceptual loss L_p as the L2 distance between the feature maps of x and G(w') extracted by a pre-trained VGG network
# Define the regularization loss L_r as the L2 distance between w and w'
# Define the total loss L_R as the weighted sum of L_p and L_r
# Optimize R by minimizing L_R with gradient-based optimization
# Obtain the refined pivot code w' = R(w)

# Step 3: Generator Tuning
# Initialize a tuning function T that consists of a set of learnable parameters for each affine layer of G
# T updates the affine layers of G by adding or multiplying the learnable parameters
# Define the perceptual loss L_p as the L2 distance between the feature maps of x and G'(w') extracted by a pre-trained VGG network
# Define the adversarial loss L_a as the cross-entropy loss between the output of a pre-trained discriminator D and the label of real images
# Define the total loss L_T as the weighted sum of L_p and L_a
# Optimize T by minimizing L_T with stochastic gradient descent
# Obtain the tuned generator G' = T(G)

# Return w' and G'
