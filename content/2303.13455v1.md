Here is a summary of the paper at [^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- What: The paper proposes **CoBIT**, a **Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text Generation Model** that can perform both image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks, as well as image and image-text understanding tasks.
- Why: The paper aims to unify three pre-training objectives: contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, which are usually done separately on image-text pairs. The paper argues that these objectives complement each other and can improve the performance of vision and language tasks, especially in zero-shot scenarios.
- How: The paper introduces a novel unicoder-decoder structure, consisting of an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge. The paper jointly pre-trains CoBIT on contrastive loss, image-to-text generation loss, and text-to-image generation loss. The paper evaluates CoBIT on various tasks such as image classification, retrieval, captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE, and text-based content creation. The paper shows that CoBIT achieves superior results compared to existing methods, especially in zero-shot settings.

The paper at [^1^][1] claims the following contributions:

- It proposes **CoBIT**, a **unicoder-decoder architecture** that can perform both **image-to-text and text-to-image generation** tasks, as well as **image and image-text understanding** tasks, in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.
- It jointly pre-trains CoBIT on **three objectives**: contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, which are usually done separately on image-text pairs.
- It introduces a novel **switchable encoder-decoder mechanism** that allows the image/text unicoders to encode or decode in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge across modalities.
- It achieves **superior performance** on various vision and language tasks compared to existing methods, especially in **zero-shot scenarios**. For instance, 82.7% in zero-shot ImageNet classification, 9.37 FID score in zero-shot text-to-image generation and 44.8 CIDEr in zero-shot captioning.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper at [^1^][1]:

- The paper introduces a novel **unicoder-decoder structure**, consisting of an **image unicoder**, a **text unicoder**, and a **cross-modal decoder**. The image unicoder and the text unicoder are both based on the **ViT** architecture, and the cross-modal decoder is based on the **Transformer** architecture. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge across modalities.
- The paper jointly pre-trains CoBIT on **three objectives**: contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, which are usually done separately on image-text pairs. The paper uses a **contrastive loss** to align the image and text representations in a shared latent space. The paper uses a **cross-entropy loss** to train the image-to-text generation task, where the cross-modal decoder takes an image as input and generates a caption. The paper uses a **perceptual loss** to train the text-to-image generation task, where the cross-modal decoder takes a text as input and generates an image.
- The paper evaluates CoBIT on various vision and language tasks such as image classification, retrieval, captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE, and text-based content creation. The paper shows that CoBIT can perform these tasks in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, and achieves superior results compared to existing methods.
