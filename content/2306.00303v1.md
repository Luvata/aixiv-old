Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper divides the SIE algorithms into three categories: **classical image segmentation approach**, **machine learning-based approach** and **deep learning-based methods**.
- The classical image segmentation approach includes methods based on thresholding, edge detection, region growing, clustering, active contour and level set. These methods are simple and fast, but they are sensitive to noise and parameter settings, and they cannot handle complex ice scenes well.
- The machine learning-based approach includes methods based on support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic. These methods can learn from labeled data and achieve better performance than classical methods, but they require sufficient and representative training data, and they are not robust to changes in ice conditions or sensor characteristics.
- The deep learning-based methods include methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN) and transformers. These methods can learn high-level features from large-scale unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and they can handle complex and diverse ice scenes with high accuracy and efficiency. However, they also have some challenges, such as requiring a lot of computational resources, lacking interpretability and generalization ability, and suffering from domain shift and data imbalance.
