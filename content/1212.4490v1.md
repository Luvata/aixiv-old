Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a sketch-to-design system that allows users to create 3D models by sketching parts and selecting from a gallery of compatible parts based on contextual information.
- **Why**: The paper aims to facilitate 3D modeling by providing reference and inspiration from existing models, and by reducing the design space as the user sketches more parts.
- **How**: The paper uses a large collection of pre-segmented 3D models to learn part-based contextual information, such as part compatibility, part importance, and part deformation. The paper also uses a sketch analysis module to match user sketches to parts and a part assembly module to warp and align parts together. The paper evaluates the system with user studies and compares it with existing methods.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper describes the **overview** of the sketch-to-design system, which consists of four main components: a sketch interface, a sketch analysis module, a part assembly module, and a part-based contextual learning framework.
- The paper explains the **sketch interface**, which allows the user to draw strokes over a canvas that displays the current 3D model in the background. The user can also rotate, zoom, and pan the view, and undo or redo strokes.
- The paper details the **sketch analysis module**, which matches user sketches to parts and ranks them according to their relevance and context. The module uses a two-stage process: first, it extracts features from the sketches and parts, such as curvature, orientation, length, and aspect ratio; second, it computes similarity scores between sketches and parts using a weighted combination of feature distances. The module also considers the context of the existing parts in the model and filters out incompatible parts based on their labels and positions.
- The paper describes the **part assembly module**, which warps and aligns parts together to form a coherent 3D model. The module uses a deformation graph to represent each part and computes optimal graph transformations that minimize distortion and alignment errors. The module also handles part snapping and collision detection to ensure realistic and plausible assemblies.
- The paper presents the **part-based contextual learning framework**, which learns part compatibility, part importance, and part deformation from a large collection of pre-segmented 3D models. The framework uses a probabilistic graphical model to encode the joint distribution of part labels, positions, sizes, and shapes. The framework also uses a ranking SVM to learn part importance scores based on user preferences. The framework pre-computes these contextual information offline and stores them in a database for online retrieval.
