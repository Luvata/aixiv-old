Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a novel method for guiding the image generation process of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) using the gradients of an image classifier. The method is called Direct Optimization of Diffusion Latents (DOODL) and it enables plug-and-play guidance by optimizing the latent variables of DDMs with respect to the classifier loss on the final generated pixels.
- **Why**: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing classifier guidance methods, which either require training new noise-aware models or using a one-step denoising approximation that leads to misaligned gradients and sub-optimal control. The paper also showcases the potential of more precise guidance for improving the quality and diversity of image generation and editing tasks.
- **How**: The paper leverages an invertible diffusion process that allows backpropagating the classifier gradients from the final generation to the latent variables without storing intermediate states. The paper also introduces a memory-efficient gradient accumulation technique that reduces the number of forward and backward passes. The paper evaluates DOODL on various forms of guidance, such as using CLIP to generate complex prompts, using fine-grained visual classifiers to expand the vocabulary of Stable Diffusion, enabling image-conditioned generation with a CLIP visual encoder, and improving image aesthetics with an aesthetic scoring network. The paper reports that DOODL outperforms one-step classifier guidance on computational and human evaluation metrics across different settings.

## Main Contributions

The paper claims the following contributions:

- A novel method for classifier guidance of DDMs that directly optimizes the diffusion latents with respect to the classifier loss on the true generated pixels, using an invertible diffusion process to achieve memory-efficient backpropagation.
- A memory-efficient gradient accumulation technique that reduces the number of forward and backward passes required for latent optimization by a factor of 16.
- An extensive evaluation of DOODL on various forms of guidance and image generation and editing tasks, demonstrating its superiority over one-step classifier guidance on both computational and human evaluation metrics.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first reviews the background of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) and classifier guidance, and introduces the notation and terminology used throughout the paper.
- The paper then describes the main idea of DOODL, which is to optimize the diffusion latents z_0 with respect to a classifier loss L_c on the final generated pixels x_T. The paper shows that this optimization problem can be solved by applying the chain rule and using an invertible diffusion process that relates z_0 and x_T.
- The paper also presents a memory-efficient gradient accumulation technique that reduces the number of forward and backward passes required for latent optimization by a factor of 16. The technique involves splitting the diffusion process into sub-steps and accumulating the gradients over multiple sub-steps before updating z_0.
- The paper then discusses how to apply DOODL to different forms of guidance, such as using CLIP to generate complex prompts, using fine-grained visual classifiers to expand the vocabulary of Stable Diffusion, enabling image-conditioned generation with a CLIP visual encoder, and improving image aesthetics with an aesthetic scoring network. The paper also explains how to handle multiple guidance signals and how to balance them with a weighting scheme.
- The paper finally provides some implementation details and hyperparameters for DOODL, such as the choice of optimizer, learning rate, number of iterations, batch size, and guidance weights. The paper also describes the data sources and models used for Section 5.3.

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a text prompt t, a pre-trained DDM p(x_t|x_0), a pre-trained classifier c(x), and a guidance weight lambda
# Output: a generated image x_T that matches the text prompt and the classifier guidance

# Initialize the diffusion latent z_0 randomly
z_0 = sample_from_normal_distribution()

# Define the number of diffusion steps T and the number of sub-steps S
T = 1000
S = 16

# Define the learning rate alpha and the optimizer opt
alpha = 0.01
opt = Adam(z_0, alpha)

# Loop over the diffusion steps
for t in range(1, T+1):

  # Compute the forward diffusion process from z_0 to x_t
  x_t = forward_diffusion(z_0, t)

  # Compute the classifier loss L_c on x_t
  L_c = cross_entropy_loss(c(x_t), t)

  # Compute the backward diffusion process from x_t to z_0
  z_0_grad = backward_diffusion(x_t, t)

  # Accumulate the gradient of L_c w.r.t. z_0 using the chain rule
  z_0_grad = z_0_grad * gradient(L_c, x_t)

  # If t is a multiple of S or the last step, update z_0 using opt
  if t % S == 0 or t == T:
    opt.step(z_0_grad)
    z_0_grad = 0

# Compute the final generation x_T from z_0 using forward diffusion
x_T = forward_diffusion(z_0, T)

# Return x_T as the output image
return x_T
