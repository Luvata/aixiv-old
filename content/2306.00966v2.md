The method section of the paper [^1^][1] describes the proposed SegFormer framework for semantic segmentation with Transformers. It consists of four subsections:

- **Hierarchical Transformer Encoder**: This subsection introduces the design of the encoder, which is based on a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) that outputs multiscale features without using positional encoding. It also explains how to train the encoder with a self-supervised contrastive learning objective.
- **MLP Decoder**: This subsection presents the design of the decoder, which is a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) that aggregates features from different scales and produces segmentation masks. It also discusses the advantages of using MLP over convolutional or attention-based decoders.
- **Implementation Details**: This subsection provides the details of the network architecture, training settings, data augmentation, and inference strategies for SegFormer. It also introduces a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5 with different sizes and capacities.
- **Ablation Study**: This subsection reports the results of various ablation experiments to analyze the effects of different components and design choices of SegFormer, such as positional encoding, multiscale features, decoder design, and self-supervised pre-training.
