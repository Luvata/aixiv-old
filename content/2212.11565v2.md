Here is a summary of the paper based on the search results:

**What**: The paper proposes a new text-to-video (T2V) generation setting called One-Shot Video Tuning, where only one text-video pair is presented. The paper also introduces Tune-A-Video, a model that can generate videos from text using image diffusion models pre-trained on massive image data.

**Why**: The paper aims to replicate the success of text-to-image (T2I) generation for video generation, which is more challenging and computationally expensive. The paper also wants to leverage the large-scale image data and the state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models for T2V generation.

**How**: The paper makes two key observations: 1) T2I models can generate still images that represent verb terms; 2) extending T2I models to generate multiple images concurrently exhibits surprisingly good content consistency. Based on these observations, the paper designs a spatio-temporal attention mechanism and an efficient one-shot tuning strategy for Tune-A-Video. At inference, the paper employs DDIM inversion to provide structure guidance for sampling. The paper evaluates the method on various applications and shows its remarkable ability.

Here is a summary of the method section based on the search results:

The method section consists of four subsections: 1) Preliminaries, 2) One-Shot Video Tuning, 3) Tune-A-Video, and 4) Inference.

- In the Preliminaries subsection, the paper reviews the background of image diffusion models and DDIM inversion, which are the basis of their method.
