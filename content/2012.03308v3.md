Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes TediGAN, a novel framework for multi-modal image generation and manipulation with textual descriptions. It can produce diverse and high-quality face images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024x1024 pixels. It can also synthesize images with different modalities, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance.
- **Why**: The paper aims to make image generation and manipulation more readily and user-friendly by using natural language as the input. It also aims to unify text-guided image generation and manipulation into one same framework, leading to naturally continuous operations from generation to manipulation. It also aims to facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis by introducing a new large-scale dataset, Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ.
- **How**: The paper uses three components: StyleGAN inversion module, visual-linguistic similarity learning, and instance-level optimization. The StyleGAN inversion module maps real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The visual-linguistic similarity learning learns the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. The instance-level optimization is for identity preservation in manipulation. The paper also uses a control mechanism based on style-mixing to support multi-modal inputs.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- **A novel framework for text-guided image generation and manipulation** that can produce diverse and high-quality face images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024x1024 pixels. It can also synthesize images with different modalities, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance.
- **A unified model for generation and manipulation** that can seamlessly switch between the two tasks by using a control mechanism based on style-mixing. It can also preserve the identity of the input image when performing manipulation.
- **A new large-scale dataset for text-guided multi-modal synthesis** called Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, which consists of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. It can facilitate the research and evaluation of text-guided image synthesis methods.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper uses **StyleGAN inversion module** to map real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. It uses a perceptual loss and a regularization term to optimize the latent code and the noise maps for each image. It also uses a style-mixing technique to control the degree of manipulation for different semantic levels.
- The paper uses **visual-linguistic similarity learning** to learn the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. It uses a contrastive loss to maximize the similarity between matched image-text pairs and minimize the similarity between unmatched pairs. It also uses a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to ensure that the text can be reconstructed from the image embedding and vice versa.
- The paper uses **instance-level optimization** to preserve the identity of the input image when performing manipulation. It uses an identity loss to measure the similarity between the input and output images in terms of facial identity. It also uses a text-image consistency loss to ensure that the output image matches the textual description.


## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# Input: a textual description t and an optional real image x
# Output: a synthesized image y that matches t and preserves the identity of x if given

# Step 1: StyleGAN inversion
if x is given:
  # Find the latent code w and the noise maps n that best reconstruct x
  w, n = optimize(w, n | x)
else:
  # Sample a random latent code w and noise maps n
  w, n = sample(w, n)

# Step 2: Visual-linguistic similarity learning
# Encode the textual description t into a text embedding e_t
e_t = encode(t)
# Encode the latent code w into an image embedding e_w
e_w = encode(w)
# Find the optimal manipulation direction d that maximizes the similarity between e_t and e_w + d
d = optimize(d | e_t, e_w)
# Apply the manipulation direction d to the latent code w to get the manipulated latent code w'
w' = w + d

# Step 3: Instance-level optimization
if x is given:
  # Find the optimal style-mixing coefficient alpha that balances between identity preservation and text-image consistency
  alpha = optimize(alpha | x, t, w')
  # Apply style-mixing to the latent code w' with alpha to get the final latent code w''
  w'' = style_mixing(w', alpha)
else:
  # Use the manipulated latent code w' as the final latent code w''
  w'' = w'

# Step 4: Image synthesis
# Generate the output image y from the final latent code w'' and the noise maps n
y = generate(w'', n)
```
