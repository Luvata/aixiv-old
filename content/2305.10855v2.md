## What, Why and How

Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper introduces TextDiffuser, a system that uses diffusion models to generate images with text that is coherent with the background and the text prompt.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of rendering accurate and coherent text in image generation, which is important for applications such as data augmentation, content creation, and text inpainting.
- **How**: The paper proposes a two-stage approach: first, a Transformer model generates the layout of keywords extracted from text prompts, and then diffusion models generate images conditioned on the text prompt and the generated layout. The paper also contributes a large-scale text images dataset with OCR annotations, MARIO-10M, and an evaluation benchmark, MARIO-Eval, to measure text rendering quality. The paper shows that TextDiffuser can create high-quality text images using text prompts alone or together with text template images, and can also perform text inpainting to reconstruct incomplete images with text.

- **MARIO-Eval**, a benchmark to serve as a comprehensive tool for evaluating text rendering quality.
- **Experiments and user studies** that demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TextDiffuser for various text image generation tasks.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a two-stage approach for text image generation: **text layout generation** and **image synthesis**.
- In the text layout generation stage, the paper uses a Transformer model to generate a layout of keywords extracted from text prompts. The layout consists of bounding boxes and text labels for each keyword. The paper uses a pre-trained LayoutLMv2 model  as the backbone and fine-tunes it on the MARIO-10M dataset. The paper also introduces a novel loss function that encourages the model to generate diverse and realistic layouts.
- In the image synthesis stage, the paper uses diffusion models to generate images conditioned on the text prompt and the generated layout. The paper adopts the DDPM framework  and modifies it to incorporate text and layout information. The paper also introduces a novel attention mechanism that allows the diffusion model to attend to different regions of the layout based on the text prompt. The paper trains the diffusion model on the MARIO-10M dataset using a combination of reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and adversarial loss.
- The paper also describes how to use TextDiffuser for various text image generation tasks, such as generating images from text prompts alone or together with text template images, and performing text inpainting to reconstruct incomplete images with text. The paper provides details on how to prepare the inputs and outputs for each task.

## Pseudo Code - High level

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```python
# TextDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Text Painters

# Input: text prompt T, (optional) text template image I
# Output: text image G

# Text layout generation stage
keywords = extract_keywords(T) # use a keyword extraction model
layout = generate_layout(keywords) # use a fine-tuned LayoutLMv2 model

# Image synthesis stage
if I is given:
  layout = merge_layout(layout, I) # use a simple heuristic to merge the two layouts
noise = sample_noise() # sample Gaussian noise
G = synthesize_image(noise, T, layout) # use a modified DDPM model with text and layout attention

# Return the generated text image
return G
```

## Pseudo Code - Detail

Here is the detailed pseudo code to implement this paper:

```python
# TextDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Text Painters

# Input: text prompt T, (optional) text template image I
# Output: text image G

# Hyperparameters and constants
num_keywords = 5 # number of keywords to extract
num_boxes = 10 # number of bounding boxes to generate
num_timesteps = 1000 # number of diffusion timesteps
beta = 0.0001 # noise scale factor
lambda_1 = 1.0 # weight for reconstruction loss
lambda_2 = 0.1 # weight for perceptual loss
lambda_3 = 0.01 # weight for style loss
lambda_4 = 0.001 # weight for adversarial loss

# Text layout generation stage
keywords = extract_keywords(T, num_keywords) # use a keyword extraction model such as RAKE or YAKE
layout = generate_layout(keywords, num_boxes) # use a fine-tuned LayoutLMv2 model with a novel loss function
# The layout is a list of tuples (x1, y1, x2, y2, label) where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the bounding box and label is the text label

# Image synthesis stage
if I is given:
  layout = merge_layout(layout, I) # use a simple heuristic to merge the two layouts based on the overlap and similarity of the boxes and labels
noise = sample_noise() # sample Gaussian noise from N(0, I)
G = noise # initialize the generated image with noise
for t in range(num_timesteps): # iterate over diffusion timesteps
  epsilon_t = sample_noise() * sqrt(beta * t) # sample timestep-specific noise
  G = G + epsilon_t # add noise to the image
  G = denoise(G, T, layout) # use a modified DDPM model with text and layout attention to denoise the image
  # The DDPM model consists of a U-Net encoder-decoder with skip connections and residual blocks
  # The text and layout attention modules are inserted between the encoder and decoder layers
  # The text attention module computes the attention weights between the text prompt tokens and the image features using dot-product attention
  # The layout attention module computes the attention weights between the layout boxes and the image features using geometric attention

# Return the generated text image
return G

# Training procedure
# Use the MARIO-10M dataset as the training data
# For each training batch:
  # Sample a text prompt T and a text image X from the dataset
  # Generate a text layout L using the text layout generation stage
  # Generate a noisy image Y using the image synthesis stage with X as the input image
  # Compute the reconstruction loss as L1(Y, X)
  # Compute the perceptual loss as L2(F(Y), F(X)) where F is a pre-trained VGG network
  # Compute the style loss as L2(G(Y), G(X)) where G is the Gram matrix of F
  # Compute the adversarial loss as log(D(Y)) + log(1 - D(X)) where D is a discriminator network that distinguishes real and fake images
  # Compute the total loss as lambda_1 * reconstruction_loss + lambda_2 * perceptual_loss + lambda_3 * style_loss + lambda_4 * adversarial_loss
  # Update the parameters of the DDPM model and the discriminator network using gradient descent
