Here is a summary of the paper:

- **What**: The paper proposes a network architecture to perform variable length semantic video generation using captions.
- **Why**: The paper aims to provide semantic control over video generation and to learn the long-term and short-term dependencies between video frames.
- **How**: The paper adopts a recurrent attentive approach that generates one frame at a time, conditioned on the caption and the previous frames. The paper also introduces a novel loss function that incorporates perceptual, adversarial and temporal losses. The paper evaluates the network on two datasets: UCF-101 and MSR-VTT.

According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- A network architecture that performs **variable length semantic video generation using captions**[^1^][1] [^2^][2].
- A novel loss function that incorporates **perceptual, adversarial and temporal losses**[^2^][2].
- A methodology for selectively combining information for conditioning at various levels of the architecture using **appropriate attention mechanisms**[^2^][2].
- A network architecture that learns a **robust latent representation** that allows it to generate videos in an unsupervised manner and perform other tasks such as action recognition[^1^][1] [^2^][2].

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper:

- The paper proposes a network architecture that consists of three main components: a **caption encoder**, a **video generator**, and a **video discriminator**[^1^][2].
- The caption encoder is a bidirectional LSTM that encodes the caption into a fixed-length vector representation[^1^][2].
- The video generator is a recurrent attentive network that generates one frame at a time, conditioned on the caption and the previous frames[^1^][2]. It consists of two sub-modules: a **frame generator** and a **frame selector**[^1^][2].
- The frame generator is an LSTM that generates a frame feature vector at each time step, using an attention mechanism over the caption vector and the previous frame feature vector[^1^][2].
- The frame selector is another LSTM that selects one part of the frame to be generated at each time step, using an attention mechanism over the frame feature vector and the previous frame selector state[^1^][2].
- The video discriminator is a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between real and generated videos, using an adversarial loss[^1^][2]. It also incorporates a perceptual loss and a temporal loss to improve the quality and coherence of the generated videos[^1^][2].

Here is the high-level pseudo code for this paper:

```
# Input: a caption C
# Output: a video V

# Encode the caption C into a vector h using a bidirectional LSTM
h = caption_encoder(C)

# Initialize the video V as an empty list
V = []

# Initialize the frame feature vector f and the frame selector state s as zeros
f = 0
s = 0

# Repeat until the end of video token is generated or a maximum length is reached
while True:

  # Generate a frame feature vector f using an LSTM with attention over h and f
  f = frame_generator(h, f)

  # Generate a part of the frame p using an LSTM with attention over f and s
  p = frame_selector(f, s)

  # Update the frame selector state s
  s = s + p

  # Append the part of the frame p to the video V
  V.append(p)

  # If p is the end of frame token, reset f and s to zeros
  if p == end_of_frame:
    f = 0
    s = 0

  # If p is the end of video token, break the loop
  if p == end_of_video:
    break

# Return the video V
return V

  # Repeat for k = 1 to K or until the end of frame token is generated
  for k in range(1, K + 1):

    # Compute the attention weights alpha and beta over h and f using a softmax function
    alpha = softmax(U_f * tanh(W_f * h + V_f * f))
    beta = softmax(U_p * tanh(W_p * f + V_p * s))

    # Compute the context vector c as a weighted sum of h and alpha
    c = sum(alpha * h)

    # Generate a frame feature vector f using an LSTM with input c and previous state g

# Define the perceptual loss as a mean squared error between real and generated videos in a feature space
perceptual_loss(V) = mean_squared_error(feature_extractor(V), feature_extractor(real_video))

# Define the temporal loss as a mean squared error between consecutive frames in a feature space
temporal_loss(V) = mean_squared_error(feature_extractor(V[:-1]), feature_extractor(V[1:]))

# Update the network parameters using gradient descent to minimize L
