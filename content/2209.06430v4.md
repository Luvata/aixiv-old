Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1] in terms of What, Why, and How:

- **What**: The paper proposes a method called CLIP-ViP, which adapts a pre-trained image-text model (CLIP) to video-language representation alignment by post-pretraining on video-text data.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the challenge of transferring the knowledge learned from image-text data to video-text tasks, and to overcome the limitations of data scale and domain gap between language sources.
- **How**: The paper introduces an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method that leverages multiple sources of video-text data with different modalities and granularities, and a Video Proxy mechanism that reduces the computational cost and memory footprint of video processing. The paper also conducts extensive experiments and analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CLIP-ViP over existing methods.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper is one of the first to explore factors that hinder video post-pretraining on pre-trained image-text models, such as data scale and domain gap between language sources.
- The paper proposes CLIP-ViP, a method that can effectively leverage image-text pre-trained model (CLIP) for video-text pre-training by using an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method and a Video Proxy mechanism.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of CLIP-ViP and shows that it improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art results on several video-text datasets.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][1]:

- The paper first introduces the CLIP model, which is a pre-trained image-text model that learns a joint embedding space for images and texts using a contrastive loss function.
- The paper then describes the Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method, which is a post-pretraining method that leverages multiple sources of video-text data with different modalities (e.g., video clips, video frames, images) and granularities (e.g., sentence-level, paragraph-level, document-level) to enrich the cross-modal representation.
- The paper also presents the Video Proxy mechanism, which is a technique that reduces the computational cost and memory footprint of video processing by using a proxy network to encode video frames into compact vectors and then feeding them to the CLIP model.
- The paper finally explains how to fine-tune the CLIP-ViP model on downstream video-text tasks, such as video-text retrieval and video captioning.
