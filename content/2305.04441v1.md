Here is a summary of the paper[^1^][1]:

- **What**: The paper proposes a new technique called **Prompt Tuning Inversion** for text-driven image editing using diffusion models. Diffusion models are a type of generative models that can produce realistic images from text prompts.
- **Why**: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods for text-driven image editing, such as the lack of user-friendliness, generalization, or fidelity to the input image. The paper claims that its method can achieve intuitive and versatile modification of images with only a target text prompt, while preserving the structural information of the input image.
- **How**: The paper's method consists of two stages: a reconstruction stage and an editing stage. In the reconstruction stage, the paper uses a learnable conditional embedding to encode the information of the input image via Prompt Tuning Inversion. In the editing stage, the paper uses a classifier-free guidance to sample the edited image, where the conditional embedding is calculated by linearly interpolating between the target embedding and the optimized one obtained in the first stage. The paper evaluates its method on ImageNet and compares it with state-of-the-art baselines.

According to the paper[^1^][1], the main contributions are:

- The paper proposes a new technique called **Prompt Tuning Inversion** for text-driven image editing using diffusion models, which can achieve accurate and quick inversion of real images to noisy latents that can be edited with text prompts.
- The paper introduces a **classifier-free guidance** mechanism for sampling the edited image, which can ensure a superior trade-off between editability and high fidelity to the input image.
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of its method on ImageNet and shows that it can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of user-friendliness, generalization, and fidelity.

Here is a summary of the method section of the paper[^1^][2]:

- The paper's method is based on text-guided diffusion models, which are a type of diffusion models that can generate images conditioned on text prompts. Diffusion models generate images by reversing a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to an image until it becomes a pure noise sample. The paper uses a pretrained diffusion model called DDIM [18] as the backbone of its method.
- The paper's method consists of two stages: a reconstruction stage and an editing stage. In the reconstruction stage, the paper aims to invert a real image x to a noisy latent z that can be used by the diffusion model to reconstruct x. To do this, the paper uses a technique called Prompt Tuning Inversion, which optimizes a learnable conditional embedding e that encodes the information of x and guides the sampling process of z. The paper uses a text prompt that describes x as the input for e, and minimizes the reconstruction loss between x and the sampled image from z and e. The paper also applies some regularization techniques to improve the quality and diversity of z and e.
- In the editing stage, the paper aims to sample an edited image x' that matches a target text prompt t'. To do this, the paper uses a technique called classifier-free guidance, which does not rely on any pretrained classifier or discriminator to guide the sampling process. Instead, the paper uses another conditional embedding e' that encodes the information of t' and interpolates it with e to obtain a mixed embedding e''. The paper then samples x' from z and e'' using the diffusion model. The paper claims that this technique can ensure a smooth transition between x and x' and preserve the structural information of x.

```python
# Input: a real image x and a target text prompt t'

# Load a pretrained text-guided diffusion model D

# Reconstruction stage: invert x to a noisy latent z and optimize e
for i in range(num_iterations):
  # Sample z from the diffusion model D conditioned on e and t
  z = D.sample(e, t)
  
  # Sample x_hat from the diffusion model D conditioned on z and e
  x_hat = D.denoise(z, e)
  
  # Compute the reconstruction loss between x and x_hat
  loss = L(x, x_hat) + R(z, e)
  
  # Update e by gradient descent
  e = e - lr * grad(loss, e)

# Editing stage: sample x' from the diffusion model D conditioned on z and a mixed embedding e''
